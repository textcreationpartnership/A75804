            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Beloved Diſciple</hi> of the Lord telleth us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18. <hi>That in his time there were many Antichriſts;</hi> Many that did ſeeme to profeſſe Chriſt, yet in truth did oppoſe him, which in words would confeſſe him, but in <hi>works would denye him,</hi> Tit. 1.16. If the firſt Age of the Church could not eſcape the fuery of Satan: and if thoſe more pure times did not avoide the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled rage of his Antichriſtian Darlings: we that live in the latter dayes, which are the perillous times, muſt not look to be free from Satans oppoſition, nor hope to be exempted from the malice of his Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Factours. For the myſtery of iniquity which was but hatching, in the Apoſtles dayes, is now grown to it's full maturity: it then began onely to worke, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. it is now acting with the <hi>efficacy of Satan with all power, and ſignes, and lying wonders,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.9. And however there are many Antichriſts in the world, yet according to <hi>Johns</hi> threefold diſcription of them, we may worke them into three heads; For they are ſuch as deliver poyſonous Doctrine not truly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Gods Word, and doe oppoſe, firſt, the Divine Nature of Chriſt: ſecondly, the Humane Nature of Chriſt: thirdly, the Offices of Chriſt.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:121305:3"/>
            <p>Firſt, there are <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> who doe oppoſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of Chriſt, as <hi>Cerinthians, Arrians, Samo-Satenians, Jews, Turkes,</hi> and in a word, the <hi>Sarcinians,</hi> whoſe Doctrine is as it were a filthy ſinke, into which al the Hereſies of former and latter Ages have emptyed themſelves. Theſe the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> directly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22, 23. <hi>He is Antichriſt that denyeth the Father and the Sonne.</hi> For although never any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Heretick did in words deny the firſt Perſon; and however they may pretend with the blinded Jews, and miſled Turkes, they doe honour the Creatour of the World: yet by taking away that perſonall relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he hath to the Sonne, they deny him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to be a Father, and diſhonour both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne.</p>
            <p>However therefore they would undeſeemedly faſten on us the Name of Antichriſt, becauſe we affirme the Lord Jeſus in Nature, and Eſſence, to be equall with the Father, whenas even the Father ſtileth him his <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> Zac. 13.7. and the Sonne, who is in the <hi>forme of God</hi> thinketh it no <hi>robbery to be equall with God,</hi> Phil. 2.7. who was the <hi>onely begotten Sonne</hi> of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14, 18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9. and ſaid, that God was his <hi>proper Father,</hi> Joh. 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8. and he is ſaid to be his <hi>proper Sonne,</hi> Rom. 8.32. (for the word tranſlated own is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the Originall) yea he is the Sonne <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. And therefore the name and nature of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> agreeth to them, and not to us; For they oppoſe the Father, and the Sonne, and by denying Chriſt to be the eternall Sonne of God, they deny alſo God the Father to be a true and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father. Thus doe they robbe them both of their excellent glory: making the one to be no proper Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſt, and the other to be no proper Sonne of God, whom they blaſphemouſly affirme to be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:121305:3"/>
            <p>Secondly, they are <hi>Antichriſts</hi> who deny the Humane Nature of Chriſt, as <hi>Marcionites, Valentinians, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> and others; They take away the benefit of his death and paſſion. The Apoſtle doth more eſpecially point at theſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.3. and 2 <hi>John</hi> 7. where he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to be of an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Spirit, <hi>that denyeth Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, they are <hi>Antichrists</hi> who doe not oppoſe directly the perſon of Chriſt, but by delivering Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contrary to the Word, doe oppoſe Chriſt in his three-fold Office.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they depive <hi>Christ</hi> of his Kingly Office, and make the Pope the Supreame, and uncontroulable Head of the Church, <hi>exalting him above all that is called God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. namely above Angels, Magiſtrates, Divels, which in Scripture are called Gods; yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove God, and Chriſt, whenas they give power to him to preſcribe Lawes, which are more authentique to them, then the Laws of God. None being of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpence with his, as he can, and doth with Cods Lawes. And they attribute ſuch ſoveraignty to him, as not onely to forgive ſinnes on earth, but to place, or diſplace ſoules in Heaven, or in Hell at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they take away the Propheticall Office of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For they in ſtead of teaching the Doctrine of Chriſt, teach the Doctrine of the Devils, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Setting up Legens, Councels, Decreees, Decretals, Traditions, and their corrupt gloſſes of the Text a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Scripture. And with their Anagogicall, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall, and Tropicall interpretations of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, have quite taken away the true ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they diveſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> of his Prieſtly, Office;
<pb facs="tcp:121305:4"/> by Indulgencies, Pardons, Penances, Pilgrimages, Maſſes, Dirges, Purgatory, workes of Supererogation, and a thouſand the like inventions, have taken away the one al-ſufficient Oblation, and ſatisfaction of Chriſt. All whoſe wearing ſervice ſhall one day have no better reward, then, who required this at your hands? yea, that which in a word overthroweth all the Doctrine of Chriſt, and was enough. If Rome had ſtood guilty of no other errour, to have made us to ſeparate from her, even her ſoule-deſtroying Doctrine of Juſtification by Workes. For as the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Jewes, told the true Church of Rome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>They being Ignorant of Gods Righteouſneſſe, and going about to eſtabliſh their own</hi> Righteouſneſſe, have not ſubmitted themſelves to <hi>the Righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> Theſe the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> principally deciphereth in the Revelations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>However, theſe <hi>Antichriſts</hi> are divided, and doe craſh one againſt another, yet all doe fight againſt Chriſt, and doe oppoſe his Church. They being like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes, joyned together by the tailes, with the fire of diſſention betwixt them, whereby they doe ſet on fire Gods dearely beloved Vin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yard.</p>
            <p>And although <hi>Antichriſt</hi> had alwayes a mouthfull of blaſphemies, yet never were there more loathſome blaſphemies belched forth from the rotten hearts of his corrupt followers, then in theſe latter dayes. For now many in a prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded zeale againſt the whore of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> have joyned with the falſe prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and out of a ſeeming oppoſition to the Romaniſh <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> have imbraced the Turkiſh <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> whereby the hearts of ſound profeſſours have been ſadded; thoſe who have been weake in the faith, have had their faith ſhaken, and others who before were wavering,
<pb facs="tcp:121305:4"/> have been toſſed to and fro, with the ſtormy winds of erroneous Doctrine, and have ſplit themſelves on the ſoule-deſtroying Rocks of Hereticall opinions, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably blaſpheming God, and deploredly making ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of faith, and a good conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, it maketh my heart to melt, and my ſoule to mourne in ſecret, to ſee how greedily men ſuch in this <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> poyſon, in ſtead of the pure milke of the Word; poyſoning thereby there owne ſoules, and with their poyſonous breath endangering, if not infecting the ſoules of others; making them to vilifie the Sonne of God, and to doe deſpite to the ſpirit of Grace.</p>
            <p>Now that which firſt revived this curſed Monſter of opinion in our Fathers dayes, was carnall policy. For ſome <hi>Polonians, Tranſylvanians,</hi> and other <hi>Turkiſh</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers out of ſiniſter reſpects, and baſe ends, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to reconcile God and <hi>Belial,</hi> Chriſt and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Chriſtianity and <hi>Turciſme</hi> together.</p>
            <p>But that which hath ſince heightned their pride, and made them bold to fight againſt the Lord Jeſus, and his holy Spirit, and yet to promiſe themſelves Victory beforehand in this their unequall combate: is firſt, their naturall blindneſſe, which maketh them to have the groſſe conceits of God, and of his ſimple Nature; They conceiving him to be like ſome corporall Subſtance, and therefore require alike inſtance in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this myſtery, whereas the Lord is of a pure, ſpirituall, tranſcendent Nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Pride, who although they cannot fully underſtand what their own ſoules are, yet dare to think they can comprehend, and bound the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible God in the narrow limits of corrupted
<pb facs="tcp:121305:5"/> reaſon, and therefore as <hi>Peter</hi> propheſieth of them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. <hi>They ſpeake evill of the things they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not,</hi> who therefore ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruptions. And as he ſheweth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 1. <hi>By denying the Lord that bought them, bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es ſwift deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Giant-like ambition, who thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves able to reſiſt truth, though manned with a whole army of Martyrs confeſſours; Fathers living in all Ages of the Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Groſſe Ignorance, and falſe gloſſes of the Scripture, which they <hi>wreſt to their own deſtruction,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the not conſidering of Gods wrath againſt them, which have formerly undertaken this and the like cauſe, as againſt <hi>Arrius, Cerinthus, Olympius, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> the Arrian Emperour, <hi>Pope Anaſtatius.</hi> 2. <hi>Julian.</hi> and divers other as ye may ſee recorded in the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, Ruffin. Tripart. Hiſtor. Platin. Cyril.</hi> For that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>Korah</hi> and his Companions, was true in theſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.29. <hi>They dyed not as every man dyeth, neither were they viſited after the viſitation of all. Arrius,</hi> and <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> which went to eaſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, voided their own bowels into a Jakes. <hi>Oerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> killed with the fall of a Houſe, <hi>Olympius</hi> was ſlain with thunder and lightning, <hi>Valens</hi> burnt in a Cottage, <hi>Julian,</hi> if not ſlain with a darte from Heaven, yet with a Dart directed by a divine hand, which being ready to give up the Ghoſt, he took it out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and threw it towards Heaven, and cryed out, <hi>Thou haſt overcome me, O Galilean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But haply ſome will object againſt me, firſt, why I ſhould adventure to traffique in publike, when others who have more, and greater Talents, yet deſire to keep theirs private.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:121305:5"/>
            <p>In briefe, all that I ſhall ſay for my ſelf is this; An earneſt deſire of doing good, hath put me on this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and hath made me to ſeeme careleſly prodigall of my little; Oh that it were as fervent in richer hearts, and that they would traffique in the like kind. How would the Church of God which is <hi>beautifull as Tirzech, comely as Jeruſalem,</hi> be alſo then <hi>terrible</hi> to the enemies thereof, <hi>as an Army with Banners?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as yet (me thinks) I heare oppoſed truth cry aloud for helpe, and doe ſee the languiſhing Church robbed of her Children, with cheeks bedewed with teares, bewailing her ſelf, and ſpreading her hands, imploring aid of all her friends, and crying out in the bitterneſſe of her ſoule to all that paſſe by. Look away from me, for I will weep bitterly? labour not to comfort me, becauſe of the ſpoyling of the Daughter of my people.</p>
            <p>Oh that all in their ſeverall places, would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to quench theſe horrid flames of Doctrinall Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and that to this end they would with the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6. <hi>draw water out of their hearts, and poure it out of their eyes before the Lord, and beſeech him to put to his hand, becauſe they have almoſt deſtroyed his truth, by</hi> wickedly trampling under foot his Chriſt, and by miſerably blaſpheming his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, others that are more learned, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps blame my plaineneſſe of Language, and diſlike my labour for want of elegant expreſſions, and haply, becauſe I have not cited the Fathers that have copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly written of this ſubject.</p>
            <p>But theſe I beſeech, that they would not diſlike truth, becauſe ſhe commeth plainly attyred, nor diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Doctrine, although ſhe weareth a homely
<pb facs="tcp:121305:6"/> dreſſe. The ſtrength of the matter was the thing that I aimed at, and not elegancy of words: and the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the argument was more intended by me, then any neateneſſe of ſtile. Beſides, I held it moſt fit to ſpeake of the Lord in his own words, and not in the wiſedome of ſpeech, and I deſired Gods holy Spirit, rather then mans enticing words.</p>
            <p>As touching the Fathers, I have indeed ſeldome ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, not out of any diſlike of them: but becauſe I know they are diſliked, ſlighted, and contemned of the enemies of this truth. And becauſe the thing I propoſed, was the confirmation of this point by Scripture.</p>
            <p>Where if I ſhould have uſed Hamane Eloquence, this Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct of all other is moſt unfitting. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in which want of words doth more wrong us, or can more grieve us, then in the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this miſterious truth. Where many things may be adored, which we cannot ſearch into: many things may be ſearched in, which we cannot conceive: and many things be conceiued, which we cannot ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The path of this truth is narrow, ſlippery, ſteep, and therefore it will not admit of a ſtragler, to rove up and down in a wandring diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Some there be that may carp at the word Eſſence, Trinity, and Perſons, which I have uſed.</p>
            <p>To theſe I anſwer, firſt, in every Art this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is granted, to uſe termes of Art, which haply are no wayes uſed but in that Art: and why ſhould Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity which is more excellent then all Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences be debarred that common priviledge, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inferiour Art, and Science hath granted to it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the thing is in the Scriptures, if not the
<pb facs="tcp:121305:6"/> word, and it is a vanity to dote about queſtions, and ſtrife of words, when as we agree in the thing.</p>
            <p>The word being but the ſhadow, and the thing the ſuſtance, and therefore the word neceſſarily followeth the thing, as the ſhadow the body. And ſurely did not men diſlike the truth, they would never quarrell with the words that expreſſe it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the words were uſed in the Church long before the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> as ye may ſee in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Ireneus, Juſtin, Martyr, Clemens, Alexand. Syprian, Origen, Tertul. Lactant.</hi> and others, yea, and the ſame of theſe words are uſed by the enemies of this truth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the words Eſſence, Trinity, Perſon.</p>
            <p>Thuſchija, or Eſſence derived of Jaſcha fuit, is uſed of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Job</hi> 12.16. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Eſſence is moſt properly aſcribed to God, who alone hath Eſſence of himſelf, and all things have their eſſence from him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the word Eſſence were not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet the Adverſaries cannot deny, there is that which is equivolent to it. As for example, the Names of God, both in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Jehovah. Jah, Ehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeh,</hi> all derived of the Hebrew Roote, <hi>Havah,</hi> or <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> that ſignifieth <hi>to be,</hi> and alſo the Names of God in the New Teſtament, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4, 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 41, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.5. <hi>He that was, and is to come, and I am,</hi> Joh. 8. whoſe conjugate is Eſſence.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the word Trinity, though not found in the Scriptures, yet the word three being uſed of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. it followeth from the equivolency of its conjugate; even as the word Unity is not found in the Scriptures, but the word One being uſed, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth from the equivolency of its conjugate alſo.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:121305:7"/>
            <p>Secondly, If the word Three were not ſo uſed, yet Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and Prophets Name, Three, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. Joh. 15.26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as touching the word <hi>Perſon,</hi> which we uſe, becauſe we have no fitter. The Greek word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is applyed to the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. as alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is aſcribed to the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. to the Sonne, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6. in the Greek; <hi>David</hi> inviteth all to worſhip his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom he introduceth, ſpeaking; which was the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. which Greek words are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated by the word Perſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if that may be called a <hi>Perſon,</hi> which hath perſonall Acts aſcribed to it. Surely then the word <hi>Perſon</hi> may be given to the Father, to the Sonne, and to the Holy-Ghoſt, for we have all three ſpeaking in the firſt, ſpoken to in the ſecond, and ſpoken of in the third Perſon. I might inſtance in many hundred pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, I ſhall onely name a few.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you have all three ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the firſt.

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, you have all three ſpoken to in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, you have all three ſpoken in the third, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. where to ſhew there is none greater, nor leſſer then other: you have, firſt, the Spirit, and from him are derived gifts, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4: ſecondly, the Son,

            <p>If men were not blinded with ſinne, they might ſee this their great errour, in fighting againſt the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and his Spirit. The Lord open their eyes to ſee the glorious light of the truth, and draw their hearts to imbrace it.</p>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Name that was not to be expreſſed, either in regard of the Grecians, which out of want of Letters could not write it, or in reſpect of the Jewes, which out of ſuperſtition would not ſpeake it.</p>
                  <p>This Name, becauſe it could not be written in Greek, hath the force of it opened by the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4, 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. ſtyling the Lord, <hi>He that is, that was,</hi> and <hi>that will be,</hi> or <hi>is to come.</hi> And that you may know he expreſſeth an Hebrew Name, he varieth not the Caſes according to the manner of the Greekes, but ſpeaking in the Genitive Caſe, he putteth this Name in the Nominative, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Hebrew forme, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Je,</hi> the firſt ſyllable of the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is a note of the time to come; <hi>Jeheveh,</hi> He will be: <hi>Ho,</hi> a ſigne of the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; <hi>Hoveh,</hi> He that is: and <hi>Vah,</hi> a Characteriſticall marke of the time paſt; <hi>Havah,</hi> He was, or hath beene.

                  <p>Secondly, Although this Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is a Name of Gods Eſſence, and is alwayes uſed Singularly, and never Plurally, as <hi>Elohim</hi> and <hi>Adonai</hi> are; (which are Names of God in regard of his Perſonalitie, or Subſiſtence, and the Lord ſtyleth himſelfe one <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Deut. 6.4. but never one <hi>Elohim</hi>) yet the ancient Jewes before Chriſt, did note the myſterie of the Trinitie, in their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121305:13"/> expoſitions of this Name, by twelve, and by fortie and two Letters, which they called <hi>Sem Hamphoras.</hi> Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt, was their expoſition of this Name by twelve Letters, in Hebrew: And the Father is God, the Sonne is God, and the Holy-Ghoſt is God, three in one, and one in three, is their expoſition of that Name by fortie and two Letters; it being written likewiſe with ſo many, as <hi>R. Judas Nagid. R. Hacadoſh, R. Moſes Ben Mammon,</hi> and others obſerve: Adding moreover, that this myſterie was to be kept ſecret untill the comming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> who ſhould more clearely reveale it; <hi>R. Hacadoſh</hi> in <hi>Galarazeia.</hi> Yea, they were ſo Catechized in the myſterie of the Trinitie, that, as <hi>P. Fagius</hi> obſerveth on <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. they collected this myſterie out of this Name; which, although it was called <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> or the Name of foure Letters, yet (ſay they) there were but three ſorts of Letters in it: (י <hi>Jod</hi>) ſignified the Father, who was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all things; (ן <hi>Vau</hi>) is a conjunction copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and denoted the third Perſon; (ה <hi>He</hi>) ſignified the Sonne of God: And they affirme, this Letter is doubled, to demonſtrate both Natures of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Theſe, and the like obſervations, you may ſee in the learned Workes of the much admired and ever to be honoured, <hi>Mornaeus de verit. Chriſt. Relig. P. Calat.</hi> and others, who have ſufficiently proved, that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter Doctors of the Jewes beleeved this myſterie; albeit their latter Rabbins, in oppoſition to the Lord Jeſus, doe oppoſe it. And ſurely, the Jewes in Chriſts time were acquainted with this Truth, in that they accuſe Chriſt of Blaſphemie, when as he ſaid he was <hi>the Sonne of God,</hi> Joh. 10.33. Firſt, becauſe he being but a man, as they thought, yet made himſelfe God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.33. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe he made himſelfe (as they rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded) equall with God, when as they ſaid, God was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:121305:13"/> his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18. They not denying, that there was a Sonne of God, which was equall with the Father; but denying him to be that Word, and Sonne of God; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming him whom they accuſed of Blaſphemie, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.64, 65. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.7. And that the Holy-Ghoſt was knowne to them, is evident, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20. where the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel telleth <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that <hi>Mary</hi> was with Child by the Holy-Ghoſt. And <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Holy-Ghoſt, and with fire,</hi> Mat. 3.10. In vaine had he ſpoken to them of the Holy-Ghoſt, of whom they had not heard of before. That place, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.2. where the Diſciples had not heard whether there were an Holy-Ghoſt, it cannot be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if they were ignorant of his Perſon, but of the gifts of Tongues, and Propheſying by him: for firſt, being Diſciples, they were baptized in the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt: ſecondly, when the Holy-Ghoſt is uſed Perſonally, he is pointed out with one, if not with two Articles, in the Originall; whereas when the word is uſed metonymically, for his Gifts and Graces, you have uſually no Article in the Greek prefixed, as in this and divers other places. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you have the ſame expreſſion uſed by the Evangeliſt <hi>John. Joh.</hi> 7.39. <hi>The Holy-Ghoſt was not:</hi> He was in Perſon before, he was as touching ſanctifying Graces before; but he was not <hi>yet</hi> poured forth on the Diſciples (as <hi>Joel</hi> propheſied, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28.) in gifts of Tongues, and miraculous operations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This incommunicable and eſſentiall Name of God is ſometimes uſed Perſonally, and is then aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed either to tho Father, or to the Sonne, or to the Holy-Ghoſt: for,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Gen. 19.24. <hi>The Lord rained fire and brimſtone from the Lord;</hi> where you have the Sonne executing Judgement from <hi>Jehovah</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:121305:14"/> and <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.2. <hi>The Lord ſaid to Satan, The Lord rebuke thee:</hi> where one, that is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ſpeaketh of another <hi>Jehovah;</hi> namely, Chriſt ſpeaketh of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The Kings of the earth ſtand up againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as in the two afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited places, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24. <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.2. where the Sonne is ſtiled <hi>Jehovah,</hi> even as the Father is. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>This is the Lord, we have waited for him,</hi> who alſo did <hi>ſwallow up death in victorie,</hi> Iſa. 25.8. which was the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. in whom that Propheſie was fulfilled. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> is to <hi>prepare the way of</hi> Jehovah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.3. which was the <hi>way of the Lord</hi> Chriſt, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.76. It was the Lord Jeſus, who was <hi>valued at thirtie pieces of ſilver,</hi> Mat. 27.9. whom <hi>Zacharie</hi> calleth <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Zach. 11.13. <hi>I will ſave them by the Lord their God,</hi> Hoſ. 1.7. A Propheſie fulfilled in Chriſt, who is <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſſe,</hi> Jer. 23.6. Six times, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. is he called <hi>Jehovah;</hi> which, that it was Chriſt of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh, is cleare, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ke upon me whom they have pierced:</hi> which <hi>John,</hi> a faithfull eye-witneſſe, ſheweth it was fulfilled in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.34, 35. and as a true interpreter, affirmeth, that this Propheſie was ſpoken of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.37. He it was, that <hi>appeared</hi> to the Patriarchs and Saints in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.30, 32. who was then oft called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> Exod. 3. Gen. 18. Judg. 6. Exod. 13.22. who is likewiſe ſtiled <hi>an Angel of the Lord,</hi> Exod. 14.19. who oft tooke the <hi>name</hi> of an Angel, but never the <hi>nature</hi> of an Angel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. he being no <hi>created</hi> Angel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.13. but the <hi>uncreated</hi> Angel of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3.1. <hi>The Mediator betweene God and us,</hi> Zach. 2.10, 11. <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> promiſeth to <hi>dwell</hi> among us, which was the <hi>Word, who was made fleſh, and dwelt among us,</hi> Joh. 1.14. who is our God, and we are his people.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is <hi>Jehovah. Ezekiel</hi> calleth him <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Ezek. 2.4. Ezek. 11.5. which he before called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 2.2. Ezek. 11.1, 5. It was the Holy-Ghoſt, who gave orders for the Tabernacle; ſo the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. whom <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Lev. 19.2.

Yea, the

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet that Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt are one Lord of Hoſts, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> maketh plaine, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1, 3, 5. when he was ſent by him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9. Firſt, that this was the Father, if any denie, <hi>Iſaias</hi> manifeſteth it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.16.

Thirdly, that it was the Holy-Ghoſt, who ſent him, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.16. and <hi>Paul</hi> putteth it out of doubt, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.25. Thus one God, diſtinguiſhed into three Perſons, Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt, hath one and the ſame glory, and is one and the ſame Lord of Hoſts, in nature, ſubſtance, and eſſence, though they are diſtinct from each other, by their mutuall relations to each other: the Father begetting the Sonne, the Sonne being begotten of the Father, and the Holy-Ghoſt proceeding from the Father and the Sonne.</p>

Or being uſed in the Singular Number, yet it hath a Nowne Plurall joyned with it, <hi>Job</hi> 35.10. <hi>None ſaith, Where is God my makers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, the Scriptures in theſe divers conſtructions did point out this myſterie of the three Perſons; the like not to be found of Angels, men, or Idols: though the Jewes of latter times, in their blaſphemous oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, have earneſtly endevoured to ſhew it, if poſſibly they could.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Neither the Name <hi>Elohim,</hi> nor any other Name of God, is uſed plurally, when it is ſpoken of one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or of one man, as it is of one God. As for that place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.1. this Name is given improperly, or tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically, to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was the Lords Embaſſadour to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and did thereby repreſent the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt, who did ſend him, and who did deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hand, as I purpoſe to manifeſt. He therefore repreſenting the glorious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, hath a Name given him of God, which doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the nature of this Tri-une Lord that ſent him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For <hi>Baalim,</hi> and other Idols, which are uſed plurally, and have the Name of <hi>Elohim</hi> given to them: Firſt, <hi>Baalim</hi> was a Name given by the Jewes to the true God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. and ſo might be uſed by them as <hi>Elohim</hi> and <hi>Adonai</hi> are. The Jewes being Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:121305:19"/> gave not onely the Worſhip of God, but alſo his Names to their Idols, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4, 5. they called the Calfe <hi>Jehovah Elohim,</hi> ſuppoſing their Idols to have, at the leaſtwiſe to repreſent the Nature of the true God: and therefore, ſecondly, they thinking to repreſent the true God by them, who is one in Eſſence, and three in Perſons, who is <hi>God alone,</hi> Pſal. 86.10. and, <hi>there is no God beſide him,</hi> Iſa. 45. who neither is nor can be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by <hi>Images,</hi> Iſa. 40.18. Act. 17.29. would have their Idols Names to repreſent the Names of the true God: thirdly, <hi>Baalim,</hi> and other names of Idols, are <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. and in other places of the Scripture, uſed plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to expreſſe the ſeverall ſorts of their Idolatries; there being many <hi>Baals,</hi> and Idols, worſhipped by the Jewes, who oft changed their Idols, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.36. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.15, 16, 25, 26, 28, 29. and multiplied their gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of their Cities, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If we ſhould grant, the Hebrewes did uſe ſometimes the Plurall Number for the Singular, yet it is not their uſe, to put in the Plurall Number that which hath no pluralitie of Nature; as in expreſſing of the true God, to uſe theſe plurall words, <hi>Elohim,</hi> and <hi>Adonai,</hi> if there were but one Perſon in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>

Though this Name be given to Creatures, yet it is but analogically, and is not pointed in the ſame manner, as it is when it is uſed plurally for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.

This Name is aſcribed to all three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father hath this Name given to him by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.1. as the Apoſtle alledging this Pſalme, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. intimateth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is ſo ſtiled; <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord,</hi> Pſal. 110.1. the Father ſaid to his Sonne: and, <hi>the Lord, whom ye ſeeke, ſhall come into his Temple,</hi> Mal. 3.1.

                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.4. he is there ſtiled the <hi>Lord,</hi> which in the ſecond Verſe is called the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and ſo likewiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.1, 6.</p>
                  <p>Yea, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> manifeſteth this truth more clearely; where God, called <hi>Adonai,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> or, <hi>who ſhall goe for us?</hi> Iſa. 6.8. <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> There is the Unitie: and, <hi>who ſhall goe for us?</hi> There is the Trinitie.

                  <p>But firſt, <hi>Caſheh</hi> may be a Subſtantive, and it may be tranſlated, <hi>Lords of Crueltie:</hi> but if <hi>Caſheh</hi> be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Singular, and <hi>Adonim</hi> a word Plurall, joyned to it; it then may note the multitude of <hi>Maſters</hi> which the captived Egyptians ſhould ſerve: and yet their una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie in crueltie towards theſe Egyptians, which though many, yet ſhould joyne as one man, in Lording over that ſlaviſh people: So that this place maketh not againſt the Argument, for the proofe of the Trinitie, from the uſe of the word plurally.</p>

The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the rule of our faith, denyeth the one, but aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the other, by aſcribing the Name of God, not onely to the Father, but alſo to the Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt; where we may eaſily perceive, that the Apoſtles, and other Pen-men of the new Teſtament, when they ſpeake of the Father, and of the Sonne together, call the Father, God, and the Sonne, Lord; but ſpeaking of them apart, or ſeverally, they uſe both theſe names pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, giving this Name God, indifferently to Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt: For,</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:121305:22"/>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father is God; <hi>God, who in ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in times paſt unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Sonne,</hi> Heb. 1.1, 2. And <hi>to us there is but one God the Father,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6. This is not ſpoken exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, as if the Sonne and Holy-Ghoſt were not God with the Father, but incluſively, by way of incluſion of the Sonne and Holy-Ghoſt; The Sonne being in the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>Sonn,</hi> John 14.9. 10. They being <hi>one,</hi> John 10.30. and the Holy-Ghoſt <hi>proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from both, John 15.26. John 16.7. Gal. 4.6. Rom. 8.9, 11. This onely excludeth Idols, not deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> nor his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> to be <hi>one God with the Father,</hi> no more then the verſe following, ſaying, <hi>One Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> denyeth the Father to be Lord, or excludeth him from having any Dominion over us. And as the Father is included in the latter, ſo the Sonne and Holy-Ghoſt is included in the former.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is <hi>God.</hi> Rom. 9.5. <hi>Of whom, as concerning the fleſh, Chriſt came, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever.</hi> There are two Reaſons, why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle treating of the Jewes, doth ſet forth the Divinity of the Lord Jeſus. 1. For the honour of Chriſt, whom the Jewes blaſphemed. 2. For the honour of the Jews, whoſe manifold priviledges, ver. 4.5. he had reckoned up. In concluſion, he addeth this as the greateſt, he putteth it in the laſt place, as the weightieſt: That <hi>Chriſt who is God over all bleſſed for ever, came of them.</hi> And ſurely, if the Lord Jeſus had no other Nature but Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, it had been needleſſe for the Apoſtle to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe words, <hi>(according to the fleſh)</hi> but he was the <hi>onely begotten Sonne of the Father,</hi> John 3.16. The Sonne of <hi>himſelfe,</hi> Rom. 8.3. his <hi>proper</hi> Sonne, Rom. 8.32. And therefore of the ſame eſſence with God his Father: He being oppoſed to Men and Angels, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:121305:23"/> adopted, or created ſonnes of God; he therefore had another Nature from God his Father, namely Divine, which he tooke not from <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father; For <hi>before Abraham was, I am;</hi> (as he ſaith) John 8.58. The Apoſtle putteth this out of doubt, 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>Without controverſie great is the myſtery of godlyneſſe, God was manifest in the fleſh.</hi> There is not any thing more myſterious, there cannot be a greater wonder, then that God, who is <hi>immortall,</hi> ſhould take our <hi>fleſh,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>mortall:</hi> That he, who thundreth in the <hi>Clouds,</hi> ſhould lye ſprawling in a <hi>Cratch:</hi> That he, who was in the <hi>forme of God,</hi> ſhould take on him the <hi>forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> He, that was the <hi>Lord of all,</hi> the <hi>maker of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and had all the <hi>Manſions</hi> therein at his diſpoſing; ſhould for our ſakes become <hi>poore,</hi> have no <hi>Houſe</hi> to put his head in, and ſhould be ſo diſreſpected of a common Inne, that he which came to ſave men, ſhould take up his firſt lodging with Beaſts. What wonder had it beene to <hi>men,</hi> or <hi>myſtery</hi> worthy for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> to <hi>pry into,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. To have ſeene a Creature <hi>manifested in the fleſh,</hi> as ſome impiouſly thinke, and blaſphemouſly ſpeake of Chriſt? But he was God, who redeemed us with <hi>his owne blood,</hi> Act. 20.28. For God to love his rebellious Enemies, and to <hi>lay downe his life for us,</hi> John 3.16. was <hi>love</hi> in him, beyond imitation, fit for our moſt ſerious admiration. In Chriſt <hi>dwelt all the fulneſſe of the God-head bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. Where, 1. There was not divine qualities onely reſident in him, but there was the <hi>God-head,</hi> that <hi>dwelt</hi> in him. 2. It was not a little meaſure thereof, but the <hi>fulneſſe of the God-head.</hi> 3. It is not onely ſaid the <hi>fulneſſe,</hi> but <hi>all the fulneſſe of the God-head.</hi> He hath the full nature of God, as the Father hath; yea, <hi>all that the Father hath,</hi> Joh. 16. (he ſaith) <hi>was his:</hi> the Father having a divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him, the Sonne hath the ſame divine Nature in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:121305:23"/> him. He is <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us. He was in the <hi>forme of God, and thought it no robbery to be equall with God;</hi> yet <hi>made himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke on him the forme of a ſervant, and was made in the likneſſe of man; he humbled himſelfe, and became obedient to death, &amp;c.</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7. Loe you have the two Natures of the Lord Jeſus deſcribed: where you have his divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſet forth, and his equality therein with his Father plainely expreſſed; he was in the <hi>forme of God,</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with God:</hi> as alſo his humane Nature, he was in <hi>the forme of a ſervant.</hi> For the one doth as clearely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his God-head, as the other doth his Man-hood. 2. Not onely the Father ſtileth the Sonne his <hi>fellow,</hi> Zach. 13.7. but alſo the Lord Chriſt himſelfe <hi>thought it no robbery to be equall with his Father,</hi> Phil. 2.6. Why ſhould any robbe him of that honour, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſcribeth, and he knew due to himſelfe? 3. He made himſelfe of <hi>no reputatiton,</hi> or rather he emptied himſelfe; of what? even of his divine Majeſty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he did as it were lay aſide. 4. What great patterne of humility had it been in him, if he had not been <hi>equall</hi> with his Father, to have <hi>humbled himſelfe, and become obedient</hi> to his Father? But John 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> And 1 John 5.20. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt, he addeth, <hi>This is the true God, and eternall life.</hi> Heb. 1.8. <hi>Thy throne,</hi> O <hi>God, is for ever and ever.</hi> It is the Lord Chriſt, whoſe Majeſty is there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Yea, <hi>Thomas</hi> acknowledged him to be God and Lord, <hi>Jehovah Elohim,</hi> John 20.28. <hi>My Lord and my God,</hi> which was not a fooliſh exclamation, or a fond admiration (as ſome would make it) but a faithfull acclamation, &amp; a holy confeſſion. For, 1. Here is no note of exclamation, it is <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:121305:24"/> But he knew the Father to be God and Lord: This ſpeech therefore concerned God the Sonne, whoſe Humanity he touched when he acknowledged his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. 3. Chriſt both commended and condemned his faith, John 20.29. He commendeth the matter of his <hi>beleeving,</hi> though he condemneth the manner of his beleeving. <hi>Iude</hi> ſheweth how many <hi>ungodly men</hi> did broach this blaſphemous errour, in <hi>denying</hi> Chriſts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. They <hi>deny that onely God,</hi> and Maſter, <hi>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for ſo it ought to be read, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Chriſt, who is our God, that created us; our Maſter, that redeemed us; our Lord, that ruleth in us. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. ſpeaketh of the ſame men by way of <hi>Propheſie.</hi> And it could not be ſpoken of the Father: for never any Hereticke denyed the Divinity of the Father. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth our Saviour, God, Tit. 1.3. <hi>According to the commandement of God our Saviour.</hi> And ſurely, he that readeth diligently the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall finde God, or Lord, and Chriſt, to be uſed oft reciprocally for each other, as, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10, 11, 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. with 34. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10, 13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is <hi>God. Peter</hi> calleth him <hi>God,</hi> Act. 5.3, 4. whom he afore had called the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> for reproving <hi>Ananias,</hi> for lying to the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> he aggravateth his ſin, by ſhewing him what the Holy-Ghoſt is: <hi>Thou haſt not lyed to men, but to God.</hi> Againe, Act. 11.17. <hi>Foraſmuch then as God gave them the like gift, as he did unto us, who beleeved on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: what was I, that I ſhould withſtand God?</hi> That it was the Holy-Ghoſt, whom he twice calleth God, appeareth, by comparing this verſe with the 15. verſe. The <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> gave them the like <hi>gift,</hi> as he did <hi>unto us.</hi> He fell on theſe Gentiles, and gave them the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:121305:24"/> 
                     <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> as he did to the Apoſtles, and other Jewes. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe manifeſteth the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt to be <hi>God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16, 17. <hi>Know ye not, that ye are the Temples of God, and that the ſpirit of God dwelleth in you: If any man defile the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy; for the Temple of God is holy, which Temple ye are.</hi> Three times doth the Apoſtle call the Holy-Ghoſt, God: Yea, that text doth afford three ſeverall arguments to confirme unto us the Deity of the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Apoſtle proveth the <hi>faithfull</hi> to be the <hi>Temples of God,</hi> becauſe the Holy-Ghoſt <hi>dwelleth in them;</hi> which argument were invalide, and of no force, if that holy Spirit were not <hi>God.</hi> 2. The Holy-Ghoſt <hi>dwelleth</hi> conſtantly in the <hi>Faithfull,</hi> as in one <hi>Temple.</hi> Three times is the word <hi>Temple</hi> uſed ſingularly. He u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteth all the Elect in all the world in <hi>one,</hi> and ſo <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> in them all, as if they all were but <hi>one,</hi> and yet ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and comfortablely <hi>dwelleth</hi> in <hi>one,</hi> as if that <hi>one</hi> were <hi>all;</hi> It being proper to God alone, to be ſo infinitely boundleſſe in his ſubſtance, as thus to fill all places. 3. We being the <hi>Temples of the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God.</hi> It was unlawfull to make Temples of wood or ſtone, but to the true <hi>God.</hi> He therefore muſt needs be <hi>God,</hi> who hath ſo many, and ſuch ſtately <hi>Temples</hi> as the <hi>faithfull</hi> are. The Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> Luke 1.35. ſhewing that Chriſt ſhould be <hi>conceived</hi> by the <hi>power of the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> addeth in the 37. verſe: For, <hi>with God nothing ſhall be impoſſible.</hi> Plainely manifeſting, that the Holy-Ghoſt, who was to effect this great worke, was God. Yea our Lord Chriſt manifeſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth him to be God; <hi>Have ye not read that which was ſpoken to you by God? ſaying, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 22.31. Was it not the Holy-Ghoſt who <hi>ſpake</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. And therefore the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:121305:25"/> which were <hi>inſpired</hi> by the Holy-Ghoſt, are ſaid to be inſpired of <hi>God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. It is ſaid of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he was warned of <hi>God</hi> by an holy <hi>Angel</hi> to ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 10.22. which <hi>Angel</hi> is called an <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> Acts 10.3. Yet he, who ſent to warne him, was the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> for ſo he himſelfe telleth <hi>Peter,</hi> that he <hi>ſent them,</hi> Acts 10.20. where you ſee, that the Holy-Ghoſt hath twice the Name of <hi>God</hi> aſcribed to him: yea, the Names of <hi>God</hi> and of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> are often changed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.2. <hi>He that ſpeaketh in an unknowne tongue, ſpeaketh not to men, but to God; howbeit, to the Spirit he ſpeaketh myſteries,</hi> and not onely in the New Teſtament, but in the Old, as <hi>Ezek</hi> 2.2, 4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.1, 5. <hi>Num.</hi> 24.2, 4. and divers other places. Thus Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt, are abſolutely, and definitively called <hi>God,</hi> without limitation, addition, or correction of ſpeech, (as Creatures are not) who though three Perſons, yet but one true ever-living God, of one and the ſame ſubſtance. <hi>I, and my Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>are one,</hi> John 10.30. One in every thing, but in that wherein the oppoſition of relation diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. That our Saviour is one with the Father by identity of Eſſence, appeareth, 1. By his owne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>John</hi> 7.29. <hi>I know him, for I am of him, and he hath ſent me.</hi> 2. By the Jewes accuſation, for they did not challenge him for affirming himſelfe to be ſome Vice-gerent or ſecond Prince, but for making himſelfe equall to <hi>God,</hi> John 5.18. and that being <hi>Man,</hi> made himſelfe <hi>God,</hi> John 10.33. which thing in both places is juſtified, and maintained by our Saviour. They are therefore one in Eſſence, will, and action, not in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the Holy-Ghoſt is likewiſe one with Chriſt; and therefore you have Chriſt appearing in a <hi>Viſion</hi> to <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 1.13. and deſcribed by <hi>Iohn</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all his ſeven Epiſtles to the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:121305:25"/> the Perſon that writeth to them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1, 8, 12, 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1, 7, 14. Yet in the concluſion of all theſe ſeven Epiſtles, it was the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that ſpeaketh and writeth thus to the <hi>Churches,</hi> and whom they are commanded to heare: <hi>Let him that hath eares heare what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches,</hi> Rev. 2.7, 11, 17.29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.6, 13, 22. Thus Father and Sonne are <hi>one</hi> and the holy Spirit and the Sonne <hi>are one;</hi> yea, all <hi>three are one,</hi> 1 John 5.7.</p>

And therefore the Lord Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſend the Holy-Ghoſt, who ſhould teach them <hi>all things,</hi> John 14.26. ſaith, he will not leave them <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,</hi> John 14.16. Plainely ſhewing, the Holy-Ghoſt ſhould be their <hi>Father.</hi> Yea, ſo the Holy-Ghoſt promiſeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 18. <hi>I will be a Father to you, and ye ſhall be my Sonnes and Daughters.</hi> That he which maketh this promiſe to us, is the holy Spirit, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out of the former verſes: For we are to him, that maketh this promiſe to us, <hi>Temples,</hi> and he it is that <hi>dwelleth</hi> in us: Now it is manifeſt we are <hi>Temples of the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19. and he <hi>dwelleth</hi> in us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>Though theſe be three ſubſiſtences, or Perſons, yee they be one in eſſence, ſubſtance, or nature, and to us one <hi>Father,</hi> Mal. 2.10. O <hi>Lord, thou art our Father</hi>

Thomas</hi> ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.28. <hi>My Lord, and my God:</hi> the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> doth ſo ſtile him; for it was Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> was to goe <hi>before,</hi> Mar. 1.2.

                     <hi>Lord God Almighty,</hi> is a Name aſcribed to the Father, to the Sonne, and to the Holy-Ghoſt.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LOrd God Almighty</hi> is a Name given to God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his protection over his Church and people, and alſo of the deſtruction of his and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. There can be but one <hi>Lord God Almighty,</hi> but he is diſtinguiſhed into three Perſons, or ſubſiſtences, which is ſo called.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father is <hi>Lord God Almighty,</hi> who with the Sonne and Holy-Ghoſt is uſually ſo ſtiled in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Revel. 11.17. Rev. 15.3. Rev. 16.7. Rev. 19.6. I know ſome expound ſome of theſe places perſonally of the Father, others expound them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally of the Sonne: But I rather take them eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, as ſpoken of the Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt; neither is the Father onely ſo ſtiled; But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is <hi>Lord God Almighty,</hi> Rev. 1.8. (ſo <hi>Paguine</hi> rendreth it, and alſo other Greek and Latine Copies. That this is ſpoken of the Sonne, the words before and after ſhew, it being interpoſed between a double deſcription of Chriſt: Firſt, of his Names and Offices: Secondly, of his glorious Majeſtie appearing to <hi>John</hi> in a <hi>Viſion,</hi> as is laid down to us with its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances from the ninth verſe to the end of that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is <hi>Lord God Almighty.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. it being the Holy-Ghoſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:121305:30"/> that there ſpeaketh: firſt, it is He, who is in the <hi>faithfull,</hi> as in his <hi>temple,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19. ſecondly, He <hi>dwelleth</hi> in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. thirdly, He likewiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a <hi>Covenant,</hi> to be their God, and they ſhall be his <hi>people,</hi> Jer. 31.33. with Heb. 9.15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Albeit the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt are <hi>Lord God Almightie,</hi> yet are they not three Lords, or three Gods, or three Almighties, but one <hi>Lord God Almightie.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>GReat God,</hi> is a Title peculiarly attributed to the Lord: <hi>He is a great God above all gods,</hi> 2 Chron. 2.5. there being <hi>none ſo great a God as our God,</hi> Pſal. 77.13. Pſal. 86.8. even his enemies being <hi>Judges</hi> Ezra 5.8. who ſtile him the <hi>great God.</hi> This Name, ſome who <hi>denie the Lord that bought them</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7.) <hi>to be God,</hi> doe peculiarly give to the Father, ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, in oppoſition to the Sonne and Holy-Ghoſt, the <hi>great God;</hi> when as they are of one Power, Majeſtie, Glory, and Eſſence with him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father is ſtiled the <hi>great God</hi> by <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 9.4. who prayed to the <hi>Lord,</hi> the Father of our <hi>Lord,</hi> (as the ſonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>Ecclus</hi> 51.14. who beſeecheth God to <hi>heare him for the Lords ſake,</hi> Dan. 9.17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is ſtiled the <hi>great God</hi> by <hi>Paul,</hi> Tit. 2.13. looking for that <hi>bleſſed hope,</hi> and the <hi>glorious appearing</hi> of the <hi>great God,</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. Firſt, the Lord Chriſt is that <hi>bleſſed hope;</hi> He is the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:121305:30"/> 
                     <hi>hope of Iſrael,</hi> Act. 28.20. and alſo him, in <hi>whom the Gentiles truſt,</hi> Rom. 15.12. Secondly, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> (as <hi>Zanch. Piſcat. Beza</hi> ſhew) is wholly and alone attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Jeſus Chriſt in the New Teſtament. Thirdly, if by <hi>great God</hi> ſhould be underſtood God the Father, and <hi>Saviour</hi> onely have relation to Jeſus Chriſt; then there ſhould be a double Article in the Greeke, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them: but here is onely one ſingle Article, which pointeth out one onely ſubject, even the Lord Jeſus, to whom theſe belong. Wherefore, if Jeſus Chriſt were not God by Nature, but onely by Office, as ſome blaſphemouſly affirme, he had not beene a <hi>great God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is ſtiled a <hi>great God:</hi> ſo ſaith the Pſalmiſt; <hi>The Lord is a great God,</hi> Pſal. 95.3. That this was the Holy-Ghoſt, the Apoſtle ſheweth, by citing that following part of the Pſalme, as ſpoken of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. He is the <hi>great God,</hi> whom he introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſpeaking, which was the <hi>Holy-Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if this Verſe be not ſpoken Perſonally of him, but eſſentially of God, yet this Title is due to him, as he is one with the Father and the Sonne; and even ſo in that and other places, (where the Name of God is taken eſſentially) it is to be referred to him, together with the Father and the Sonne.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is a <hi>great King,</hi> Pſal. 95.3. with Heb. 5.7. as I ſhewed afore, who appointeth his inferiour <hi>Officers</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> Act. 13.2. Act. 20.28. and who maketh <hi>Lawes</hi> for his <hi>people,</hi> Act. 15.28.</p>
                  <p>Yea, Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt are one <hi>King,</hi> Rev. 11.17. <hi>John</hi> treating both of the Lord; and of Chriſt, doth adde, ſpeaking as of one; <hi>He ſhall reigne.</hi> They have one Throne, which is confirmed unto us by the mouth of two Evangelicall Prophets; the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> in the New.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Iſaiah ſaw the Lord of Hoſts ſitting on a Throne,</hi> Iſa. 6.1. whom in the fifth verſe he ſtileth a <hi>King,</hi> which did ſend <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to the people of the Jewes; which was not onely the <hi>Father</hi> which did ſend <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> but the Sonne alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.16. and ſo <hi>John</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 40, 41. <hi>Theſe things ſaid Iſaias, when he ſaw Chriſts

                  <p>Firſt, the Father he is the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> Act. 3.12, 13. <hi>Ye men of Iſrael, the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our Fathers hath glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified his Sonne Jeſus:</hi> The Father of Chriſt, was the God of the Fathers of the Iſraelites, the <hi>God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne, he is the <hi>God of Iſrael.</hi> So the Angel intimateth to <hi>Zachary; Many of the Children of Iſrael ſhall John turn to the Lord their God: And he ſhall goe before him in the Spirit and power of Elias,</hi> Luke 1. 16, 17. whom did <hi>John</hi> goe before, but Chriſt, whom the Angel calleth the <hi>Lord God of Iſrael?</hi> Mal. 3.1. Mar. 1.2. Luke 1.76. Luke 7.27. who was alſo the <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> Joh, 12.13. The Prophet <hi>Zephany</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them equivalent one to the other, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.15. And <hi>Ananias,</hi> an Iſraelite, acknowledgeth to <hi>Paul, the Lord God of our Fathers hath choſen thee.</hi> That this was the Lord Jeſus <hi>Ananias</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Act</hi> 9.17. <hi>The Lord (even Jeſus, that appeared unto thee in the way) hath ſent me unto thee;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> giveth thanks to Chriſt for chooſing him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. Yea, the Lord Chriſt that appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and is called <hi>an Angel,</hi> Act. 7.30, 34. who was the Angel of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3. ſtileth himſelfe <hi>the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob,</hi> Exod. 3.6. He it was that ſent his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to <hi>John,</hi> who was the Lord God of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> Rev. 22.6. which were of Iſrael, for ſo he affirmeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> he who <hi>ſpake by the mouth of all the Prophets,</hi> Luke 1.70. was the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> Luke 1.68. That this was the Holy-Ghoſt, is evident, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.25. who <hi>ſpake by the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.2. who was the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.3. The Spirit of the Lord being called the <hi>God of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:121305:32"/>
                  <p>And indeed, Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt, which brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Egypt (as I ſhall ſhew) is the <hi>God of Iſrael:</hi> He being their <hi>God,</hi> Exod. 20.2. <hi>that brought them out of Egypt; Jehovah Elohim,</hi> Deut. 5.6. Exod. 20.2. <hi>The Lord thy Gods,</hi> one Name of God being ſingular, and the other plurall.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt have the Names of God definitively and abſolutely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated of them. And as <hi>Ireneus,</hi> who lived long before the Councell of Nice, obſerveth in his third Booke, <hi>Cont. Haereſ.

And indeed, he that is a diligent reader of the Scriptures, ſhall not finde any Name or Names of God aſcribed to the Creature, without ſome addition, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or correction of ſpeech: by which it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be diſcerned, that they are not truly God, to whom when the Name of God is aſcribed, yet is ſo limited, is ſo reſtrained; ſeeing that Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt is the <hi>God of Iſrael.</hi> Oh let us give to the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the honour due to his Name, and let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. laſt. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, from everlaſting to everlaſting, Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <hi>ETernitie</hi> is an eſſentiall Propertie of God, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable to a Creature. Firſt, ſome things there be, which have not a beginning, yet have an end; as Gods Decrees, which he from all <hi>eternitie</hi> decreed to be fulfilled in <hi>time,</hi> Eph. 1.4. Tit. 1.2. 2 Tim. 1.9. Secondly, ſome things there are, which have both a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and an ending; as all ſublunarie Creatures, except <hi>Man,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.7. Thirdly, ſome things there are, which had a beginning, and have no ending, as <hi>Angels,</hi> Col. 1.16. Joh. 1.3. And the Soules of men, which likewiſe had a <hi>beginning,</hi> Gen. 2.7. Zach. 12.1. yet are <hi>immortall,</hi> Mat. 22.30. Onely the Lord hath neither beginning, nor ending; Time being the meaſure of the Creature, not of the Creator. He inhabites <hi>Eternitie,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. His <hi>wayes are everlaſting,</hi> Hab. 3.6. He is <hi>God from everlaſting to everlaſting,</hi> Pſal. 90.2. He is not onely before the Creature, but before the making of it; from an everlaſting before, to an everlaſting after it: Or, if you will, God is not onely from everlaſting to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:121305:35"/> everlaſting, in regard of himſelfe, but alſo in reſpect of his Church, and people. He is from everlaſting before, by predeſtination; to an everlaſting after, by glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He is the King of <hi>ages</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17. ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, and diſpoſing of them according to his own will and pleaſure. He is the King of <hi>Eterritie,</hi> Jer. 10.10. He is the firſt and the laſt, and beſides him there is no <hi>God,</hi> Iſai. 44.6. Iſai. 4.1.4. He is the <hi>eternall God,</hi> Gen. 21.33. His <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>for ever,</hi> Pſal. 135.13. Thus,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father is <hi>eternall;</hi> and in this regard he is ſtiled, <hi>he which is, and which was, and which is to come,</hi> Rev. 1.4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is <hi>eternall;</hi> he hath the ſame title aſcribed to him, <hi>which is, and which was, and which is to come.</hi> Rev. 1.8. He is <hi>Alpha, and Omega, the firſt and the laſt,</hi> Rev. 1.11. Rev. 22.13. Rev. 2.8. Rev. 1.17. Who is the firſt, though not the firſt alone, becauſe the Father is with him. He is <hi>the beginning &amp; the ending,</hi> Re. 22.13. He is the <hi>everlaſting Father,</hi> Iſai. 9.6. who though born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> in regard of his humanitie; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Divinity, his <hi>goings forth hath been from of old, from everlaſting,</hi> Mich. 5.2. Or as the Originall will beare it, <hi>from the dayes of eternitie.</hi> His <hi>Kingdome is everlaſting,</hi> Iſai. 9.7. Luk. 1.33. Rev. 11.15. His <hi>Throne is for ever, and ever,</hi> Heb. 1.8. Pſal. 45.7. He is <hi>without beginning, or ending,</hi> Heb. 3.7. He <hi>liveth for ever,</hi> Rev. 1.18. Heb. 7.25. He is <hi>before all things,</hi> Col. 1.17, 18. He is <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.20. 1 Joh. 1.2. As he is the Sonne of Man, he is a <hi>Prieſt after the order of Melchizedeck,</hi> Heb. 7.15. But as he is the Sonne of God, <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> is ſaid to be like unto him, that abideth a <hi>Prieſt continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Heb 7.3. The heavens and all other creatures ſhall faile, but his <hi>yeares faile not,</hi> Heb. 1.12. Yea, the Jewes knew that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> muſt be <hi>eternall,</hi> John 12.34.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:121305:35"/> 
                     <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt proveth the <hi>eternitie</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe he had his being before any creature was <hi>created,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe he was begotten of the <hi>Father,</hi> Joh. 1.18. Joh. 3.16. he was not created, not made as creatures are: and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſheweth Chriſt to be <hi>after him,</hi> yet <hi>before him,</hi> Joh. 1.30. <hi>After him</hi> in his Humanitie, yet <hi>before him,</hi> in regard of his Divinitie. Yea, the beloved Diſciple <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, he repeateth <hi>(was)</hi> foure times, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and that Word was God: The ſame was in the beginning with God.</hi> He <hi>was, was, was, was;</hi> where can wicked blaſphemers ſhew he <hi>was not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly; the Holy-Ghoſt is <hi>eternall.</hi> He is the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Spirit,</hi> Heb. 9.14. and <hi>the everlaſting God,</hi> which gave <hi>Commandements</hi> by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> Rom. 16.26. That this was the Holy-Ghoſt, is manifeſt; For he <hi>ſpake</hi> and <hi>commanded</hi> by them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.30. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.9, 10. with <hi>Act.</hi> 28.25, 26. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.2. he <hi>abideth</hi> with the <hi>faithfull for ever,</hi> John 14.16.</p>
                  <p>The Father the Son, and the Holy-Ghoſt are conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall, coeternall, of one and the ſame Subſtance, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and Nature, being one <hi>eternall Lord God,</hi> which hath being in, and by himſelfe alone. There cannot be more <hi>infinites,</hi> nor more <hi>eternals,</hi> then <hi>one;</hi> as God is, who is one in eſſence, though diſtinguiſhed into three Perſons, Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt; which are not before or after each other, in regard of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie of Nature, Honour, or Time, but onely in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who are before or after each other, onely in order of ſubſiſting, and working. Thus the Father is before the Sonne in order, who is <hi>begotten</hi> of his Father, and <hi>doth nothing</hi> but what he <hi>ſeeth the Father doe,</hi> Joh. 5.19. And the Father and the Sonne before the Holy-Ghoſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:121305:36"/> in order, who <hi>proceedeth from them,</hi> Joh. 15.26. and who <hi>ſpeaketh not of himſelfe,</hi> Joh. 16.13. but <hi>receiveth</hi> of the Father, and of the Sonne, and ſheweth that unto the <hi>faithfull,</hi> Joh. 16.14, 15. that neither is the Sonne before or after the Father in time, neither is the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ghoſt after either of them, but being Relatives, are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by nature.</p>

                     <hi>OMnipreſency,</hi> is a propertie peculiar to God; he is ever with us, ever before us, he alwayes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth us, though our eyes ſee him not. His eſſence is immeaſurable. He filleth all <hi>places,</hi> Act. 7.49. 1 Kin. 8.2, 7. Iſai. 66.1. He is a <hi>God at hand,</hi> and a <hi>God afarre off,</hi> Jer. 23.23. God alone is <hi>every where,</hi> Pſal. 139.8, 9. Amos 9.2, 3, 4. He is not in <hi>loco definitivo,</hi> in any place definitively, as Angels are; much leſſe is he in <hi>loco cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcriptivo,</hi> in any place circumſcriptively, as corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall creatures are: But he is every where preſent, whom the <hi>Heaven of Heavens cannot containe,</hi> 2 Chron. 6.18. He is in Heaven, reigning in Glory and Majeſtie; He is in earth, ruling by his power and providence; he is in Hell, tormenting with his wrath and juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in regard of all Creatures, the immenſitie and greatneſſe of God is ſeene <hi>working in,</hi> and <hi>by them,</hi> Act. 17.28. and <hi>preſent</hi> with them; And ſo,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father is <hi>preſent</hi> in all places: his <hi>eyes</hi> are upon the children of men; and he heareth the <hi>prayers</hi> of his <hi>ſervants</hi> in <hi>all places,</hi> Joh. 16.23. he <hi>dwelleth</hi> in th <hi>faithfull,</hi> Joh. 14.23.</p>

And ſurely, where God the Father is, he is in the unity of the eſſence with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. being <hi>in the Father,</hi> and the Father <hi>in him,</hi> Joh. 14.10, 11. <hi>filling all things,</hi> Epheſ. 4.10.

                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is likewiſe <hi>every where.</hi> David demandeth, <hi>whither ſhall I goe from thy Spirit?</hi> or, <hi>whither ſhall I goe from thy preſence?</hi> Pſal. 139.7. Thus the Spirit, with the Father and the Sonne, are preſent every where; The Holy-Ghoſt abideth at all times, and in all places of the earth, in the hearts of all <hi>faithfull men,</hi> Joh. 14.16, 17. he remaineth amongſt the <hi>people of God,</hi> Hag. 2.5.

Rom. 8.9. 2 Tim. 1.14. 1 Cor. 3.16. the <hi>beleevers</hi> are his <hi>Temples,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19. this one and the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> worketh all gifts, and all graces, in all the <hi>faithfull,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.11. 2 Cor. 11.4. and is in all the hearts of the <hi>faithfull,</hi> Gal. 4.6. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in them for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. yea, the <hi>Spirit of the Lord filleth the World, and containeth all things,</hi> Wiſd. 1.7. he <hi>proceedeth</hi> both <hi>from the Father
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:121305:37"/> and the Sonne,</hi> Joh. 15.26. Joh. 16.7. and is with them, which are mutually at the <hi>right hand</hi> of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1, 5. <hi>he</hi> being <hi>alwaies</hi> where <hi>they are,</hi> Pſal. 139.7. <hi>David</hi> joyneth Gods preſence and his Spirit together, The <hi>Father and the Sonne being one in another,</hi> Joh. 10.38. and <hi>he in both,</hi> and <hi>they in him,</hi> Zac. 7.12. he is the <hi>Lambes eyes who is in the midſt of the Throne,</hi> Rev. 5.6. he is <hi>before the Throne,</hi> Rev. 4.5. and, <hi>ſent forth into all the earth,</hi> Rev. 5.6.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Didymus Alexandrinus,</hi> in <hi>Lib. de Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

                  <p>Secondly, in regard of his Church, in which God ruleth more eſpecially, as in his Kingdome, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth more particularly, as in his owne houſe, <hi>who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, and through all, and in all,</hi> Eph. 4.6. And thus, without appropriation to any Perſon, the Holy Trinitie is <hi>over all,</hi> in regard of the excellencie of his glory; <hi>through</hi> all, in reſpect of the gifts of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie; and <hi>in all,</hi> in the preſence of his dignitie: Or, if you will, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, the Father is <hi>all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.28. God is <hi>all in all;</hi> he is <hi>all,</hi> as the firſt cauſe, and working in us <hi>all,</hi> as in the ſecondary cauſes.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:121305:37"/>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is <hi>all in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. Chriſt is <hi>all</hi> &amp; in <hi>all;</hi> &amp; as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſpeaketh with a reduplication, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.31. is <hi>above all,</hi> yea, he <hi>filleth all in all,</hi> Eph. 1.23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is <hi>all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.11. <hi>All theſe worke, that one and the ſame Spirit, dividing to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſeverally as he will.</hi> He is the <hi>incorruptible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that is <hi>in all,</hi> Wiſ. 12.1. <hi>all Beleevers</hi> receive one and the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.4. There cannot be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny infinites, which are preſent in all places, for the infiniteneſſe of one would hinder the infiniteneſſe of another, if they were not one and the ſame eſſence.

                  <p>Oh that men would conſider this <hi>omnipreſencie</hi> of God! to wicked men it might be a Bridle, to ſtop their courſe in Sinne, that they <hi>runne not into all exceſſe of riot,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.4. to conſider that God is <hi>preſent</hi> with them; he that is their <hi>Judge,</hi> beholdeth them and their actions: and to good men it would be alſo a Staffe, to

Secondly, there is an actuall or limited power, a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which is <hi>limited</hi> by Gods will, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22. The Lord can doe more by his abſolute power, then he will doe by his limited power.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121305:39"/> Prophet ſpeaketh of the Spirit of the Lord, he addeth; <hi>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord?</hi> Iſa. 40.13.

                  <p>Firſt, in regard of the <hi>heart of man.</hi> The Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth: for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the <hi>heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.8. he knoweth the <hi>ſecrets</hi> thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.21. it is his prerogative to be the <hi>ſearcher</hi> of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, 10. he onely knoweth the <hi>hearts</hi> of the children of men, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.29. where,</p>

                  <p>Secondly, God the Sonne knoweth the <hi>heart,</hi> Joh. 5.42. he profeſſeth it, and <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.39. he intimateth this truth to the Jewes; <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him, as a <hi>ſearcher of the heart,</hi> to <hi>witneſſe,</hi> Rom. 9.1, he <hi>knoweth</hi> what is in <hi>man,</hi> Joh. 2.25. he <hi>knew</hi> the Imaginations of the Jewes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.42. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.39, 40. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.45. he <hi>knew</hi> the thoughts of his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.24, 25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.47. <hi>Joh</hi> 6.61, 64. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.47. he <hi>ſearcheth the heart, and tryeth the reines,</hi> Rev. 2.23. he knoweth the <hi>thoughts,</hi> moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and inclinations thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God the Holy-Ghoſt ſearcheth the <hi>heart,</hi> Wiſd. 1.5, 6. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him, as a ſearcher of the heart, <hi>to witneſſe,</hi> Rom. 9.1. <hi>he ſearcheth out the deepe things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. and therefore ſurely ſearcheth out the deepe things of man; he knew the heart of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias;</hi> (why ſaith Peter) <hi>hath Satan filled thy heart, and why haſt thou conceived this thing in thy heart?</hi> Act. 5.3, 4.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of man, and all Creatures; the Lord knoweth all things: all actions are <hi>manifeſt to him,</hi> Heb. 4.13. he <hi>knoweth all the Fowles of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,</hi> and all the <hi>Beaſts that feed</hi> thereon, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 50.

Where, though the word <hi>Father</hi> is taken eſſentially, and not Perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet the Father, with the Sonne and Holy-Ghoſt, is neceſſarily underſtood: The Father knoweth who are his, <hi>electing</hi> them <hi>according to his fore-knowledge,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne knoweth all things. <hi>Peter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it expreſſely, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Lord thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all shings;</hi> yea all the Diſciples confidently averre it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.30. <hi>now we are ſure thou knoweſt all things.</hi> The Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> calleth forth her Neighbours to Chriſt to <hi>ſee</hi> him, that <hi>told</hi> her all <hi>that ever ſhe did,</hi> Joh. 4.29. he <hi>walketh in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks,</hi> ſeeing their wayes, and knowing their works, approving them that were good, and reproving them that were evill, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1, 2, 9, 13, 19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1, 8, 15. he knew the fruitleſſe toyling of <hi>Peter,</hi> and he could direct him where he ſhould caſt his <hi>Net,</hi> which ſhall <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe a multitude of Fiſh, ſo that their Net brake.</hi> And he knew how to detaine the Fiſhes together, till their <hi>partners came and helped them, filling both their Veſſels that they began to ſinke,</hi> Luk. 5.5, 6, 7. he <hi>knew from the beginning who believed not,</hi> and who ſhould <hi>betray him,</hi> Joh. 6.64.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt knoweth all things, <hi>Wiſ.</hi> 1.6, 7. he <hi>ſearcheth all things,</hi> even <hi>the ſecret things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2, 10. If <hi>to know</hi> of himſelf the ſecrets of man, is proper to <hi>God,</hi> Jer. 17.9, 10. much more, to know the ſecrets of God, is proper to God onely.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in regard of the prediction, or fore-ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of future events. It is proper to God alone cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely to know future events. God challengeth the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:121305:41"/> Heatheniſh vanities, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.23. <hi>Shew the things that are to come hereafter,</hi> that we <hi>may know ye</hi> are <hi>Gods;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>the things that are comming, and ſhall come, let them ſhew unto them,</hi> Iſai. 44.7. Things in their cauſes may be fore-ſhowne, not onely by Satan, but alſo by men; Onely the Lord can ſhew what things neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall be, whoſe ſecond cauſes are not. Yea, he can and onely doth produce the cauſes, and alter them and their effects at his pleaſure: So true is that of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Testimonium Divinitatis eſt veritas divinationis.</hi> The Lord onely, to whom all things are preſent, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe things, that are future in reſpect of us, and doth reveale them to us, when the knowledge of them is for our good; and ſo,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father doth reveale and keep ſecret fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things, according to his holy will, and Divine pleaſure. And therefore our Saviour checking the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie of the Diſciples, demanding the <hi>time</hi> of his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the Kingdome to Iſrael,</hi> ſaith, Act. 1.7. <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his owne power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne revealeth future things, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.23. he <hi>fore-told</hi> his Diſciples <hi>all things;</hi> he fore-ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſtruction of the <hi>Citie</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> of Jeruſalem, and the manner of it, fortie yeares before it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. the Lord Jeſus, who is the <hi>Lambe</hi> in the <hi>midſt of the Throne, can alone open the Book with ſeven ſeales,</hi> Rev. 5. which can manifeſt what ſhall be to the end of the World, and can reveale it to his Church. He knew all the <hi>anſwers</hi> and <hi>paſſages</hi> that men ſhould give to his Diſciples, and they ſhould meet withall, when he ſent them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.2, 3: <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.13, 14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.10, 11, 12, 13. he ſaw what ſhould happen to <hi>himſelfe,</hi> Joh. 18.4. <hi>who ſhould betray him,</hi> Joh. 13. Joh. 6.64. <hi>the houre of his death,</hi> Joh. 2. Joh.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:121305:41"/> 19.28, 30. yea, <hi>for this end</hi> he telleth it to them, as he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.19. <hi>that ye may know that I am;</hi> a Name peculiar to God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. he <hi>teſtified</hi> what was fore-told in the Revelations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which many of them were not accompliſhed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years after: as God, he knew all things; although as man, he was ignorant of the <hi>day and houre of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Mar. 13.32.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt revealeth future things. The things that <hi>David ſpake before</hi> of, were ſpoken by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 1.16. he fore-told the generall <hi>famine,</hi> Act. 11.28. as alſo the <hi>binding</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the place where it muſt be done; although <hi>Paul</hi> was many hundred miles diſtant from that place, and much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from going thither, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.11. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.23. he it was that <hi>revealed</hi> to <hi>Simeon, that he ſhould not ſee death till he had ſeen the Lord Chriſt,</hi> Luke 2.27. he fore-ſheweth the <hi>departure from the faith in the latter dayes,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.1. <hi>he teſtified before the ſufferings of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.11. in the Old Teſtament he told the Jewes, and divers other Nations, what ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to them, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.30. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. and in the New, did ſhew all things to the Apoſtles, what ſhould <hi>come,</hi> Joh. 16.13.</p>
                  <p>Thus Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt; Firſt, doe know the thoughts and hearts of men; Secondly, doe know all the wayes and works of men, and of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Thirdly, doe know all things that are to come, and are one Omniſcient Lord God, equall in eſſence and Omniſciencie. Therefore, as the eye of the Lord is on us, ſo likewiſe let the eye of our ſoules be ever fixed on him, for our comfort, and for our direction. And let us pray, that he would <hi>guide</hi> us with his <hi>eye,</hi> Pſalm. 32.8. his eye directeth men, when no eye beholdeth them; his eye oft terrifieth them, when no eye ſeeth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:121305:42"/> them; his eye comforteth them, when no eye look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on them; and his eye counſelleth them, when no other eye is nigh them.</p>

                  <p>GOD is incomprehenſible, comprehending all things, not being comprehended himſelfe. Well might <hi>Zophar</hi> demand: <hi>Canst thou by ſearching find out God? canſt thou find out the Almightie, to perfection? it is as high as heaven, what canſt thou doe? it is deeper then hell, what canſt thou know? the meaſure thereof is longer then the earth, and broader then the Sea,</hi> Job 11.7, 8, 9. he ſheweth the infiniteneſſe of Gods knowledge to be every way paſt finding out. Yea, the Apoſtle, that could ſound as deepe as any man, yet findeth this bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe depth to be infinitely beyond his reach, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore breaketh out into an admiration. <hi>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wiſedome and of the knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out?</hi> Rom. 11.33. <hi>Job</hi> is driven to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his ignorance, and to confeſſe his errour, that he <hi>uttered things</hi> that he <hi>underſtood not, things too wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> for him, Job 42.3. and <hi>David</hi> doth tell us, that the Lords <hi>greatneſſe is unſearchable,</hi> Pſal. 145.3. and his knowledge too <hi>wonderfull</hi> for him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.6. his Majeſtie is infinitely tranſcending our knowledge; for we are <hi>rather knowne of God, then doe truly know God,</hi> Gal. 4.9.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the knowledge of the Father is unſearchable.

                  <p>Secondly, the knowledge of the Sonne is unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <hi>Agur</hi> likewiſe putteth this as an unanſwerable queſtion to all unbeleevers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.4. <hi>What is his Sonnes Name, if thou canſt tell?</hi> he hath a <hi>Name which no man knoweth but himſelf,</hi> Rev. 19.12. and thoſe which have this <hi>knowledge revealed</hi> of the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17.

                  <p>Thirdly, the knowledge of the Holy-Ghoſt is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable; he is unknown to the men of this <hi>world,</hi> who are out of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.17. but he revealeth himſelfe to his Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. who both <hi>ſee</hi> him and <hi>know</hi> him, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. and <hi>God</hi> by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p>Thus Father, Sonne and Holy-Ghoſt is one incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Lord God: whoſe incomprehenſible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie can be no otherwaies knowne of us, but as in his Divine pleaſure he hath manifeſted himſelf in his Word.

                     <hi>GOodneſſe</hi> is an eſſentiall propertie of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is every way good both in himſelfe and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all his creatures, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 33.5. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 145.9. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.68. he is <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>doth good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord is eſſentially, abſolutely, immutably and perfectly good, without any dependance on any other, and without any limitation of his goodneſſe.

                  <p>Firſt, the Father is good, who ſheweth the <hi>exceeding riches of his grace in his goodneſſe towards us through Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2.7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is good; he is the <hi>good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, that giveth his life for his ſheepe,</hi> Joh. 10.1. and <hi>knoweth his Sheepe,</hi> and is <hi>known</hi> of them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.14.

                  <p>Firſt, the Father is infinitely gracious: he is <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rich in grace,</hi> Epheſ. 2.7. and, <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> he enricheth us therewith, <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1.5, 6. and we are to pray to him for grace: ſo doth <hi>Paul,</hi> Epheſ. 1.2. Tit. 1.4. and <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 1.4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is infinitely gracious, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:121305:46"/> 1.16. He ſheweth forth <hi>all long-ſuffering</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> for a <hi>patterne for them which ſhould hereafter beleeve:</hi> From <hi>his fulneſſe we receive grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. He is a full Veſſell, his overflowings filleth all his members. The Apoſtle telleth us, of the <hi>unſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 5.8. 2 Cor. 8.9. And Chriſt telleth <hi>Paul,</hi> his <hi>grace is ſufficient for him,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. who giveth <hi>grace</hi> as he will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7. To whom we are to pray for <hi>grace.</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.23. Eph. 1.2. and <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 1.5. 2 Joh. 3. and <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is infinitely gracious. He is the <hi>Spirit of grace,</hi> Zach. 12.10. Heb. 10.29. Luk. 2.40. He is rich in <hi>grace,</hi> giving his <hi>grace</hi> as he <hi>will,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.11. The will of men, and Angels, are limited by their power; they may will more, then they can effect: but the Power of the holy Spirit, in giving <hi>grace,</hi> and in all his workes, is limited onely by his <hi>will,</hi> Iſa. 40.13. 1 Cor. 12.11. who giveth <hi>grace</hi> as he will: To whom we are to pray for <hi>grace.</hi> So doth <hi>Salomon,</hi> Cant. 4.16. and <hi>John</hi> likewiſe, Rev. 1.4.</p>
                  <p>The Father, the Word, and the Spirit, are one onely gracious Lord God.</p>

God is <hi>true</hi> in himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. and <hi>true</hi> in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to his Church and people, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.3. He <hi>cannot lye,</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:121305:47"/> Heb. 6.18. It is impoſſible for him to be mutable. He is the <hi>God that changeth not,</hi> Mal. 3.6. For, <hi>he is not as man, that he ſhould lye; nor as the ſonne of man, that he ſhould repent,</hi> Num. 23.19. <hi>Let God therefore be true, and every man a lyar,</hi> Rom. 3.4. The beſt of Creatures, even Angels, have in regard of themſelves a mutabilitie of nature: ſome <hi>continued not in the truth,</hi> Joh. 8.44. they <hi>kept not their first eſtate,</hi> Jude 6. Theſe he <hi>charged with folly,</hi> Job 3.18. Theſe, that did continue, did not ſtand through their owne ſtrength, but by vertue of Gods election of them, who are therefore called the <hi>elect Angels</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21. But the <hi>Creature is ſubject to vanitie,</hi> Rom. 8.21. No Creature is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, abſolutely, independently true; for ſo, Truth is eſſentially proper to God: who is, firſt, immutably true in himſelfe; ſecondly, he is immutably true, in reſpect of his gifts and graces, which he beſtoweth on his Church and people.</p>
                  <p>And thus, firſt, every Perſon of the Deitie is true in himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father is <hi>true</hi> in himſelfe. Chriſt telleth the Jewes, <hi>He that ſent him is true,</hi> Joh. 7.28. He is the <hi>onely true God,</hi> Joh. 17.3. The word <hi>(onely)</hi> in that place reſtraineth not the Subject, but the Predicate. You have the word <hi>(onely)</hi> twice ſo uſed in one Verſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.30. Againe, he that beleeveth on the firſt Perſon onely, excluding the Sonne and the Holy-Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not rightly on the <hi>true God,</hi> but is an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is <hi>true</hi> in himſelfe. He, with the Father and the Holy-Ghoſt, is <hi>the true God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.20. where Chriſt is called <hi>the true God.</hi> He is <hi>Truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 14.6. It is one of his Names, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is <hi>true.</hi> He is <hi>Truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.6. 1 Joh. 2.27. and therefore of the ſame eſſence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:121305:47"/> with the Father and the Sonne, who is the <hi>true God,</hi> and is <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, all the three Perſons are immutably true, in their gifts and graces; all <hi>the gifts of God being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance,</hi> Rom. 11.29.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father is immutably <hi>true,</hi> in regard of his gifts and graces: In <hi>the Father of Lights</hi> there is no <hi>variableneſſe, nor ſhadow of change,</hi> Jam. 1.17. Where, if you take the word <hi>Father</hi> either eſſentially, or perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, this Truth ſtandeth firme, That the Father is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably true, in regard of his gifts and graces.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is immutably <hi>true,</hi> in regard of his gifts and graces, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. He is the <hi>true and faithfull witneſſe,</hi> Rev. 3.14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is immutably <hi>true.</hi> He is the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> Joh. 14.17. Joh. 15.26. who will <hi>guide us into all truth,</hi> Joh. 16.13. The <hi>word which the Holy-Ghoſt ſpeaketh, muſt needs be fulfilled,</hi> Act. 1.16.</p>
                  <p>The Father, the Word, and the Spirit therefore are one <hi>true God;</hi> who is <hi>true</hi> in himſelfe, and immutably <hi>true</hi> in all his Promiſes to his Church and people.</p>

                  <p>And ſurely, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt have life.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father hath <hi>life,</hi> Joh. 5.26. he is <hi>the living God,</hi> Mat. 16.16. Joh. 6.69.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne hath <hi>life in himſelfe,</hi> Joh. 5.26. Life indeed was given to him, as he was a Mediatour of his Church; but <hi>in him is life,</hi> Joh. 1.4. and that of himſelfe, as God; and therefore Chriſt, who is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> (ſo <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calleth him) ſweareth <hi>as he liveth,</hi> Iſa. 45.25. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10.11. <hi>Job</hi> acknowledgeth, that his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth,</hi> Joh. 19.25. yea, he is <hi>the living God,</hi> for the faithfull are <hi>the Church of the living God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. but the <hi>Church</hi> is Chriſts, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. He is <hi>life,</hi> Joh. 14.6. and <hi>our life.</hi> Col. 3.4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt hath <hi>life in himſelfe;</hi> he is the <hi>incorruptible Spirit,</hi> Wiſd. 12.1. he is the <hi>living God:</hi> for the faithfull, who are ſaid to be the <hi>temples of the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19. are ſaid to be <hi>Temples of the living God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. Becauſe the Holy-Ghoſt, who is the living God, dwelleth in them, as in his Temple. <hi>The Spirit is life,</hi> Rom. 8.10. Firſt, he is the life of the ſoule, regenerating it; Secondly, he is the life of the body, <hi>quickning</hi> it, and <hi>raiſing</hi> it up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt, is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.10. <hi>the living God, (Hu Elohim Caiim)</hi> which we cannot expreſſe in Engliſh: there being one word ſingular, and another plurall joyned with <hi>Elohim,</hi> a word of the plurall number, <hi>(ipſe Dii viventes) Hu,</hi>

                     <hi>GLorie,</hi> as alſo Life, Wiſedome, Truth, Goodneſſe, Holyneſſe, &amp;c. are the eſſence of God.

                     <hi>Glorie</hi> belongeth onely to God, to whom we are to aſcribe it as moſt due, yea, onely due, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17.</p>
                  <p>There is in God, both a Perſonall and an eſſentiall glorie.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is in God a Perſonall glorie; as, Firſt, the Fathers <hi>glorie,</hi> is to beget the Sonne, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. Secondly, the Sonnes <hi>glorie,</hi> is to be begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. and to be <hi>equall</hi> with him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſts <hi>glorie,</hi> is to proceed from both, and to be equall with both.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is in God an eſſentiall glorie, which is not appropriated to any Perſon of the <hi>Deitie,</hi> but is

                  <p>Firſt, improperly, for that worſhip and honour which the Church of God aſcribe to him, both by praying to him, and prayſing of him, which is the ſame with our gloryfying of God; and of this God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.7. <hi>I will not give my glorie to another;</hi> but of this hereafter.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, the Father hath glorie in himſelfe, and giveth glorie to his Church; he <hi>prepareth a kingdome</hi> for the faithfull, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. and it is his <hi>good pleaſure to give it them,</hi> Luke 12.32. <hi>he is the Father of glorie,</hi> Eph. 1.17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne hath <hi>glorie</hi> in himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.41. <hi>Jude,</hi> verſe 24. and he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <hi>glorie</hi> to the faithfull, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. and he is the <hi>Lord of glorie,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is bleſſed. <hi>Bleſſed be the glorie of the Lord from his place:</hi> or, as the Originall will beare it; <hi>the bleſſed glorie of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 3.12. I know, that ſome referre this place to Chriſt, as ſpoken more peculiar of him; others, to Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt: but I rather think that acclamation to be given eſpecially to the Holy-Ghoſt, the <hi>Spirit of glorie,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.14. whoſe Divine work on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is twice mentioned almoſt in the ſame words both immediately before, and immediately after this accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:121305:50"/> 
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. <hi>Then the Spirit tooke me up, and I heard behind me a voyce of a great ruſhing, ſaying, Bleſſed be the glorie of the Lord from his place; I heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the noiſe of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noiſe of the wheeles over-againſt them, and a noiſe of a great ruſhing: ſo the Spirit lifted me up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt are one and the ſame bleſſed Lord God: though the Sonne hath his perſonalitie from the Father, that <hi>begetteth him,</hi> Heb. 1.5. and the Holy-Ghoſt hath his from the Father, and the Sonne, from whom he <hi>proceedeth,</hi> Joh. 14.26. Joh. 15.26. yet the Sonne and Holy-Ghoſt are God of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and have their bleſſedneſſe (as being of one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſubſtance, and nature with the Father) of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even as the Father hath, who are mutually <hi>in</hi> each other, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. the <hi>Father in the Sonne,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne in the Father,</hi> Joh. 14.11. Joh. 10.38. and the Father and the Sonne are in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Zach. 7.12. and <hi>the Spirit</hi> in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. even as the Spirit of of man is in man: being moſt abſolutely happy in action and contemplation. To whom let us give praiſe, and ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, the God of Iſrael, who onely doth wondrous things, and bleſſed be his glorious Name for ever, and let the whole earth be filled with his glory, Amen, and Amen,</hi> Pſal. 72.18, 19.</p>

                     <p>Therefore the Sonne and the Holy-Ghoſt are God, equall with the Father in Power and Glory.</p>
                     <p>The Workes of God are of two kinds:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, there is <hi>Opus ad intra, vel perſonale;</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall Workes of God, which are begun by, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in ſome Perſon of the Deitie; as, the generation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:121305:51"/> of the Sonne by the Father, and the proceſſion of the Holy-Ghoſt from the Father and the Sonne; theſe are ſimply perſonall Workes, whereby the Perſons are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from each other: Theſe, ſome call Workes of Relation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is <hi>Opus ad extra, vel eſſentiale;</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Workes of God: and they are ſuch, as are common Workes of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt, and are terminated in the Creature: where it is the Scriptures uſe, to attribute theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Workes ſometimes to one Perſon, and ſometimes to another; whereby they hold forth unto us the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie both of Nature, and of Working, which is in the Trinitie of Perſons.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Eſſentiall Workes are undivided, according to that knowne Axiome; <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extra, ſunt indiviſa:</hi> None of them doth ought for us, without all. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and I worke,</hi> Joh. 5.17. where, as <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hence every Perſon Worketh of himſelfe, according to that cauſall power which he exerciſeth; where there is not any preheminence, nor difference in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but an unitie, and identitie of one and the ſame cauſe; they having one Eſſence, there is therefore one operation; That therefore which the Father doth, the Sonne doth; and what the Father, and the Sonne doe, the Holy-Ghoſt likewiſe doth, (as I ſhall ſhew) in theſe Outward, Common, and Eſſentiall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                     <p>Yet as there is a diſtinct order of ſubſiſting, ſo they have a diſtinct manner of working; and they being three Perſons, they work in three diſtinct manners.

The Sonne having his perſonalitie from the Father, uſually worketh from the Father; <hi>The Sonne doth nothing of himſelfe, but what he ſeeth the Father doe,</hi> Joh. 5.17. Thus each Perſon Worketh according to the manner of his ſubſiſting, which manifeſteth a diverſitie of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but no difference, or inequalitie of power; For they Worke not <hi>as Inſtruments</hi> one to another, but <hi>as Co-workers, tanquam principium a principio,</hi> as one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from another, in regard of their Perſons: but as one, and the ſame Principle in regard of their Eſſence; where the Sonne, in regard of his Eſſence, he is God of himſelfe, and worketh of himſelfe, and ſo doth the Holy Ghoſt likewiſe.

                     <p>By theſe and the like places, you may ſee the weake and ſandy foundation, on which they build their faith, who make the Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt not onely to be unequall, but unlike in Nature, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>one God of whom,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6. <hi>one Lord by whom,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6. and <hi>one Spirit in whom,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3, 4, 13.

                     <p>The Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt are not inſtruments to, but co-workers with the Father, they worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Firſt, in theſe common works, which extend ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

                     <p>Thirdly, the Holy Ghoſt createth; He <hi>made</hi> man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 33.4. he <hi>made</hi> the body of Chriſt out of the ſeed of the Woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. he <hi>garniſheth the heavens,</hi> Job 26.13. he <hi>moued upon the waters,</hi> Gen. 1.2. cheriſhing them, and making them fruitfull, and fit for the creatures to live in. <hi>By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the Hoaſt of them by the Spirit of his mouth;</hi> ſo it is according to the Originall, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> But he ſpeaketh not onely of himſelfe, but his other two friends; Secondly, <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.20. but he ſpeaketh not onely of himſelfe, but of his people and Armie; Thirdly, <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 2.36. but <hi>Daniel</hi> doth ſpeake of the three Children that were his companions together with himſelfe: Fourthly, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. But the Church, although one, yet the <hi>members are many,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12. and as ſhe is one body, ſhe ſpeaketh ſingularly, but as ſhe is many members, ſhe ſpeaketh plurally.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. That God ſpake after the manner of Kings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt. That kinde of ſpeech was not then in uſe, as <hi>Abon-Ezra</hi> noteth on <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.27. Moreover in the examples of Kings ſpeeches in the Scripture, there is not the like, as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.21. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 36.23. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7. or in any King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or of <hi>Juda:</hi> after ages brought in this cuſtome among Kings.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if the Lord would at any time have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken plurally, it would have been eſpecially when he gave his Law: where although then he manifeſteth the pluralitie of Perſons, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2, 5, 7, 10, 12. and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the word <hi>Elohim</hi> plurally, yet he ſpeaketh in the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:121305:55"/> ſingular number, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2, 3, 5, 6, 7. Thirdly, Kings doe ſpeake plurally, becauſe they are publique Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and repreſent the whole Kingdome, and act by the advice of their Councels; Fourthly, Kings doe not uſe the ſingular and plurall promiſcuouſly, as the Scripture doth of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 3. That God did ſpeake to the Angels.</p>
                     <p>

All hope of obtaining pardon is quite cut off; for there is no fourth Perſon to cure this Apoſtatizing relapſe; and the Worke cannot be wrought backward: for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Perſonalitie, worketh alſo from them both, who alſo begin that Worke, which he terminateth, which he perfecteth in us. Now the Spirit worketh neither by the Father, nor by the Sonne, (as the Sonne is God, though he worketh by him, as I ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew, as he is the Sonne of man;) wherefore, where the Spirit applyeth not the blood of Chriſt, there is no remiſſion of ſinnes; for there is neither faith nor repentance wrought in that mans heart by the Spirit of God, who terminateth, and perfecteth thoſe graces; which alſo the Father and the Sonne worketh with him, in the hearts of every true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever. This ſinne therefore is alſo againſt the Father, and the Sonne, and not onely againſt the Holy-Ghoſt; but becauſe it is more immediately againſt his worke; therefore it is ſaid to be againſt the Holy-Ghoſt, who together with the Father and the Sonne, puniſheth this Apoſtaſie, by giving up ſuch a wretch to his owne hearts luſt, and by delivering him up to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Word, is a Worke of God: it is inchoative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an Eſſentiall Worke of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the whole Trinitie; though terminative, it is terminated, perfected, and conſummated in the Sonne of God, whoſe Perſonall Worke, it was to be <hi>made fleſh.</hi> Joh. 1.14. and to have two Natures, Divine, and Humane united in one Perſon; who, as he was the Sonne of God, was eternally <hi>begotten,</hi> of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> but as he was the Sonne of man, he was <hi>borne of a Woman in the fulneſſe of time.</hi> Gal. 4.4. <hi>To us a Childe is borne,</hi> Iſai. 9.6. and therefore man, <hi>to us a Sonne is given</hi> of God, and ſo he is God.</p>
                     <p>The efficient cauſe of Chriſts <hi>Incarnation,</hi> is the whole Trinitie; <hi>God ſent him,</hi> Joh. 3.34. He <hi>raiſed up</hi> this <hi>great Prophet,</hi> Deut. 18.15.18. the <hi>Lord pitched this Tabernacle, and not man,</hi> Heb. 8.2.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Father <hi>prepareth a Body for him,</hi> Heb. 10.5. He <hi>ſent his Sonne, made of a Woman,</hi> Gal. 4.4. Mat. 10.40. After all his Servants, he ſent unto them his Sonne, ſaying, <hi>they will reverence my Sonne,</hi> Mat. 21.37. Mar. 12.6.

                     <p>Secondly, the Sone, which as God, <hi>made all things,</hi> Joh. 1.3. made alſo his owne Body; for he <hi>emptyed himſelfe, and tooke on him the forme of a ſervant,</hi> Phil. 2.7. <hi>He tooke not on him the Nature of Angels, but tooke on
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:121305:61"/> him the forme of Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2.15. Here are two Natures in Chriſt; Firſt, the Nature, <hi>emptying</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and aſſuming: Secondly, the Nature <hi>taken,</hi> and aſſumed; He <hi>tooke not on him the Nature of Angels,</hi> he was no created Spirit, as they are; but he <hi>tooke on him the Seed of Abraham:</hi> and therefore ſurely, <hi>he was,</hi> before he tooke this Nature of man on him and ſo he teſtifieth of himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.58.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:121305:63"/> Prieſt after the Order of Melchizedeck,</hi> Heb. 5.10. where it is obſerveable, that Chriſt as man, is ſaid to be <hi>a Prieſt after the Order of Melchizedeck,</hi> Heb. 5.6, 10. Heb. 6.20. Heb. 7.17. but as Chriſt was the <hi>Sonne of God;</hi> ſo <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>made like unto him, a Prieſt continually,</hi> Heb. 7.3.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Sonne of God <hi>made himſelfe of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> Phil. 2.7. He voluntarily undertooke this Office, for ſo he teſtified: <hi>For this cauſe came I into the World, that I ſhould beare witneſſe unto the Truth,</hi> Joh. 18.37. <hi>Loe, I come to doe thy will, O God,</hi> Heb. 10.8.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt ſent him. He was <hi>led by the Spirit into the Wilderneſſe,</hi> Luk. 4.1. and <hi>returned in the power of the Spirit unto Galilee,</hi> Luk. 4.14. and was ſent by <hi>the Spirit to preach the Goſpell to the poore,</hi> and <hi>anointed</hi> by him, with gifts without meaſure, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18.

                     <p>Thus there is one inſeparable, and undivided Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father, the Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt, as there is one inſepparable, and undivided Nature of them.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Miracles</hi> tbat Chriſt wrought, when he lived on the earth, were wrought by the <hi>power of God,</hi> Joh. 10.38. <hi>God did them by him,</hi> Act. 2.22. they were wrought,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, by the power of the Father. The Lord telleth the Jewes, <hi>many good Workes have I ſhewed you from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:121305:64"/> the Father,</hi> Joh. 10.32. <hi>the Father that is in me, he doth the Workes,</hi> Joh. 14.10. the <hi>Sonne doth nothing, but what he ſeeth the Father doe,</hi> Joh. 5.19. He gave Chriſt <hi>the Workes that</hi> he did, <hi>to finiſh,</hi> Joh. 5.36.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by the Divine Power of the Sonne; <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things the Father doth, theſe alſo doth the Sonne like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</hi> Joh. 5.19. Thus by his owne Power, he <hi>tooke</hi> on him the <hi>forme of a ſervant,</hi> Phil. 2.6.

But the Man-hood being united to the ſecond Perſon of the God-head; he both received power of God, as he was man; and he had power of himſelfe, as he was God to worke Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; and therefore in many Miracles which he wrought, he manifeſted both his Natures; as in curing of him that was Dumbe, and Deafe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.34. <hi>He looketh up to heaven, and ſigheth</hi> as Man; but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as God: be opened. In healing the <hi>Leper,</hi> Mat. 8.3. to confound <hi>Manicheus,</hi> denying him to be Man, he <hi>touched</hi> him; and to confute <hi>Arrius,</hi> denying him to be God, he commanded, <hi>I will be thou cleane;</hi> manifeſting that he, and none other cured him, when he and none other touched him; in raiſing <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he <hi>prayeth</hi> as man, but <hi>commandeth</hi> as God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.41.43. Chriſt did oft cure without Prayer, but yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he prayed, and that for our ſakes; Firſt, that we might <hi>know</hi> he was <hi>ſent from God,</hi> Joh. 11.45. Secondly, that he might teach us what to doe, when we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any weightie imployment. As for that, where it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:121305:64"/> is ſaid, that he <hi>could doe no great Worke there, becauſe of their unbeliefe,</hi> Mar. 6.4. Mat. 13.58. We muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there is a twofold Power in God; Firſt, an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power, ſo the Lord can doe any thing, if the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof imployeth not a contradiction; Secondly, a limited Power, which is limited by his Will, and Decree; thus God by his abſolute Power, could have deſtroyed <hi>Sodome,</hi> when <hi>Lot</hi> was in it, by his limited power he <hi>could not,</hi> Gen. 19.22. Chriſt likewiſe by his abſolute Power, could have wrought Miracles in theſe unbeleeving Cities: but in regard of his limited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he could not, becauſe it ſtood not with his good will and pleaſure; in the like manner, God could by his abſolute Power, <hi>have removed the Cup</hi> from Chriſt: as Chriſt ſheweth, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.36. <hi>All things</hi> were <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to God.</hi> That therefore, which as <hi>Matthew</hi> puts it (if it be poſſible) hath telation to Gods limited Power, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.36. which is limited by his will; and therefore <hi>Luke</hi> well explaineth it, <hi>Lu.</hi> 22.42. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if thou be willing;</hi> the unbeliefe therefore of the <hi>Capernaumites,</hi> did not make Chriſt unable to doe, but it made them unfit to receive; it did not diminiſh Chriſts Divine power, but their owne mercies, which they might have recived if they would have believed; for as <hi>faith</hi> on the one ſide <hi>ſtayeth Gods hand</hi> from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Vengeance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10. ſo <hi>unbeliefe</hi> on the other ſide <hi>ſtayeth Gods hand</hi> from reaching forth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by the power of the Holy-Ghoſt; <hi>If I,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>by the Spirit of God caſt out Divels, then is the Kingdome of God come to you,</hi> Mat. 12.28. <hi>Jeſus was anointed with the Holy-Ghoſt, and with power, and went about doing good, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 10.38.</p>
                     <p>Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt therefore have one, and the ſame power of working Miracles, yea, that was

                     <p>Secondly, the <hi>Word,</hi> who being made fleſh, is the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the Covenant,</hi> Heb 8.6. 1 Tim. 2.5. Mal. 3.1. Yet he being the ſecond Perſon of the Trinitie, is the Teſtator and <hi>Covenanter</hi> of his Church: For if Chriſt be not a Teſtator, whereunto tendeth the Apoſtles rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning? <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Where a Teſtament is, there must of neceſſitie be the death of a Teſtator.</hi> Firſt, it was the Lord Jeſus that dyed; he is therefore the Teſtator, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter: ſecondly, the Church of God are <hi>his people,</hi> Mat. 1.21.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is the Author of this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.15, 16. <hi>The Holy-Ghoſt alſo is a witneſſe to us, for after he had ſaid before; This is the Covenant that I will make with them, &amp;c.</hi> And ſurely, there cannot be a better interpreter of the Leviticall Rites, then the Apoſtle: who having ſpoken of the <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> and of <hi>Divine Ordinances</hi> pertaining to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.18. which God had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. and comming to ſhew their ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, which was intended in them by God, that ordained them, he ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. <hi>The Holy-Ghost
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:121305:69"/> this ſignifying that the way out of the Holyeſt was not yet made manifeſt,</hi> while as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding; as if he had ſaid, the Holy-Ghoſt in giving theſe ceremoniall lawes, intended to ſhew, that the way to Heaven was not ſo wide, not ſo common, not ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as it ſhould be when Chriſt <hi>aboliſhed in his fleſh, the Law of Commandements, contained in Ordinances</hi> Eph. 2.15. And <hi>blotted out the hand-writing that was againſt us,</hi> Col. 2.14. Secondly, the Church of God are <hi>his People.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſheweth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. that this was the Holy-Ghoſt. appeareth by comparing this verſe, with 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. for we are the <hi>People of God,</hi> who dwelleth in us, and whoſe <hi>Temples</hi> we are; but we are the <hi>Temples of the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> 1. Cor. 6.19. 1. Cor. 3.16. and he <hi>dwelleth in us;</hi> Rom. 8.11. And Thirdly, he ſuffereth in the perſecutions of his people, and the perſecutors doe <hi>reſiſt</hi> him, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. and <hi>doe deſpite to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10.29.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, are one God in Eſſence, and have one common and eſſentiall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration; and are one and the ſame author of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Church, though in reſpect of the order of their Relations, and their perſonall manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; there is in this, and in all their workes a diſtinct order. Thus the Father maketh a Covenant with his Church by his Sonne; who is <hi>the Mediator.</hi> 1. Tim. 2.5. and through his Spirit, who is the <hi>earneſt of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi> Eph. 1.14. Which ſheweth no inequalitie in the Perſons, but onely the voluntarie diſpenſation of this, and other Divine Actions; which God in his infinite Wiſedome is pleaſed to uſe.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, the Father giveth <hi>Commandements to his Church.</hi> Thus <hi>John</hi> telleth the Elect Lady, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. <hi>I rejoyced greatly, that I found of thy Children walking in the truth, as I received Commandement from the Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Sonne giveth <hi>Commandements to his Church.</hi> Thus the Lord Jeſus telleth his Apoſtles; <hi>A new Commandement give I unto you,</hi> Joh. 13.14. not new in matter, but new in forme; we were by <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded to <hi>love our Neighbour, as our ſelves:</hi> but by the Lord Chriſt, we are commanded to <hi>love one another, as he hath loved us:</hi> yea, he telleth his Diſciples, <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye doe whatſoever I command you,</hi> Joh. 15.14. and <hi>Paul</hi> willeth the <hi>Galathians,</hi> to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo <hi>fulfill the Law of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.2. the <hi>Law of God</hi> being <hi>the Law of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.21.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt giveth <hi>Lawes to his Church;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtles in their decrees, which they ſend to the Churches of the Gentiles, ſay, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.28. <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy-Ghoſt, and to us, to lay on you no greater burthen, then theſe neceſſary things.</hi> Had this holy Aſſembly forgotten to mention God, as the Author of

Surely, if the Holy-Ghoſt were not God, he had no Authoritie to preſcribe Lawes, as neceſſary to the Church of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. yea, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man thinke himſelfe to be a Prophet, or Spirituall, let him acknowledge the things that I write are the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.37. as if he had ſaid, if there be a Prophet amon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus you may ſee the <hi>giving of Lawes</hi> to the Church, is an Eſſentiall Worke of God, common to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the Sonne, and to the Holy-Ghoſt, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be three Perſons, or Subſiſtences, yet there is in them, but one Subſtance, Nature, or Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>

                     <p>AS the Lord was the Maker, and giver of theſe Lawes: ſo he it is that is offended by the breakers of theſe Lawes.

Now as the Father, the Son, and the Holy-Ghoſt, gave the Law: ſo ſinne which is the tranſgreſſion of the Law, is committed againſt the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt, and doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to wrath.</p>

It was great love in the Sonne of man to forgive them, greater love to pray for them, but moſt great love to excuſe them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Sonne. So the Children of Iſrael ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him in the Wilderneſſe; <hi>They tempted Chriſt, and were deſtroyed of the Destroyer,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.9. and the Apoſtle telleth us, that they which <hi>wound the weake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their Brethren, ſinne againſt Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.12. he likewiſe is <hi>reproached</hi> by them that <hi>reproach</hi> his ſaints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. and <hi>perſecuted</hi> by thoſe that <hi>perſecute</hi> his people, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4. yea, ungodly Apoſtataes doe <hi>crucifie afreſh the Sonne of God, and put him to an open ſhame,</hi> Heb. 6.6.</p>

                     <p>IT is God alone, that <hi>comforteth</hi> us againſt Satans aſſaults, and delivereth us from his power; he can <hi>put a hooke into the noſe of this Leviathan, and bore his jaw through with a thorne,</hi> Job. 42. He is <hi>the God of conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Rom. 15.5. He it is that <hi>comforteth thoſe that are caſt down,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.6. He <hi>bringeth Satan under our feet,</hi> Rom. 16.20. And he <hi>maketh a way to all tentations, that we may be able to beare them,</hi> 1 Cor, 10.13. He cureth all thoſe wounds, which Satan maketh in the Soules of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, ſhall be able to ſeperate us from the love of God, that is in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.39. <hi>wee are through him more then conquerers,</hi> Rom. 8.37. Firſt, <hi>a Conquerer</hi> enjoyeth the benefit of his conqueſt, but for a while; but we enjoy an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benefit in our conqueſts. Secondly, He conquereth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:121305:85"/> only corporal enemies; we conquer ſpirituall. Thirdly, He overcommeth Men, we overcome Devils. Fourthly, Worldly Souldiers, ſubdue their enemies by killing; but the Lords Souldiers, overthrow all their enemies, by dying; yet it is not of our ſelves, but through him that loved us; we may ſay of our ſpirituall enemies as <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat</hi> ſaid of his Corporall, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 20.12. <hi>O God wee have no might againſt this great company, that commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; neither know we what to doe, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi>

                     <p>The comforting us againſt Satans aſſaults, and the deliverance from his power, the Scripture aſcribeth to the Father, the Son, and the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God the Father <hi>comforteth</hi> us; The Apoſtle pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to him to effect this, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. and giveth <hi>thanks</hi> to him for effecting it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 3.4.

And in regard of the light of Grace and Conſolation he himſelfe giveth us: the Holy-Ghoſt is ſtiled, in relation to him, <hi>another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> Joh. 14.16. <hi>we overcome Satan by the blood of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Thirdly, it is God the Holy-Ghoſt, who is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter</hi> to all the faithfull; he is oft by the Lord Jeſus ſtiled the <hi>Comforter,</hi> Joh. 14.16, 26. Joh. 15.26, Joh. 16.7.

                        <hi>ADoption</hi> is a work proper to God: He alone adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth children to himſelfe; who both can, and will, and alſo doth make them <hi>Heires of God,</hi> even <hi>joynt Heires with Chriſt in Glory,</hi> Rom. 8.17.

                     <p>Firſt, the Father <hi>adopteth</hi> us. <hi>He hath predeſtinated
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:121305:92"/> us to the adoption of children by Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1.5. It is our everlaſting happineſſe, that we are ſo neerly admitted into the preſence of God, that his onely Sonne ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth betwixt us and him; and that the Lord Jeſus <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us</hi> his <hi>brethren,</hi> Heb. 2.11. by the Fathers choice of us in him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Sonne <hi>adopteth</hi> us: <hi>As many as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, he gave power to become the Sonnes of God, even to them as believe in his name,</hi> John 1.12.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Holy-Ghoſt <hi>adopteth</hi> us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> Rom. 8.15.

                     <p>Adoption therefore is a worke of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt, being ſtiled our Father, as in the Lords Prayer; where the name Father is not taken perſonally, but eſſentially; namely, for one God diſtinguiſhed into three perſons. And ſurely the Sonne and the Holy-Ghoſt have this Name Father aſcribed to them in Scripture (as I have ſhewed) and they are with the firſt Perſon, a Father to us, not onely in regard of Adoption, but alſo in regard of Regeneration or San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; as I ſhall ſhew.</p>

                  <p>The Lord is a <hi>jealous God,</hi> Exod. 20.4. As a King of his Church he will not endure a partner in his throne: or as a Husband of her, he will not away with a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall in his bed.

                  <p>GOD is the onely proper Object of our <hi>love,</hi> whom we muſt <hi>love</hi> for himſelfe, but our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in and for God. He is to be loved with all our heart, with all our ſoule, and with all our might; <hi>this is the firſt and treateſt Commandement,</hi> Mar. 12.30. He is <hi>one Lord,</hi> Mar. 12.29. but three Perſons, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt, who is thus to be <hi>loved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father is thus to be <hi>loved.</hi> This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſuppoſeth: <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 2 John 2.15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the Sonne is thus to be <hi>loved.</hi> This our Saviour enjoyneth us to love him above our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of what neere relation ſoever he be to us, yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our ſelf; and therefore with the love required in the firſt and great Commandement. It being that love which is due to God alone, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father; and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his owne life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple. The Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them that love the Sonne,</hi> John 14.24. And no marvell for the <hi>loving of the Sonne,</hi> is the <hi>loving the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and the hating of the Sonne is the hating of the Father alſo, <hi>John</hi> 15.23, 24. Three times did the Lord demand of <hi>Peter,</hi> who had three times denyed his Lord. <hi>Simon ſonne of Jonas lovest thou me,</hi> John 21.15, 16, 17. yea, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth, 1 Cor. 16.22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:121305:106"/> be Anathema Maranatha,</hi> accurſed till the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. And ſurely, the <hi>love of Chriſt</hi> to us was bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, <hi>Ephe. 3.19.</hi> our love to him muſt be ſo likewiſe, if poſſibly we can, he is the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt,</hi> Rev. 1.17. Rev. 2.8. The firſt good cauſe, and the laſt good end he is the chiefe good to the ſoule, and therefore to be loved above all by the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is thus to be <hi>loved.</hi> This the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſuppoſeth. <hi>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1. We are <hi>begotten</hi> and <hi>regenerated of the Spirit,</hi> John 3.5, 6, 8. whom we are to love above our Brother that is <hi>begotten</hi> of him: for we are to love our Brother in him, and for him. <hi>Paul</hi> beſeecheth the Romans by the <hi>love of the ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 15.30. Not that love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he loved us, but wherewith we love him. I <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you ſaith he, for the Lord Jeſus ſake, and for the love of the ſpirit, that ye ſtrive together is your prayers to God for me;</hi> But why ſaith he, for the Lords ſake, and for the Spirits ſake, or for the love of the Spirit. Surely it was to ſet forth unto them his vehement obteſtation or greater deſire. There being a greater tye of love that we are bound withall to the Lord Jeſus, and to the Holy-Ghoſt, then there is to any particular Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to the whole Church of God, for theſe are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to be loved with the Father.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt is that one <hi>Jehovah,</hi> our God whom we muſt <hi>love with all our hearts, with all our ſoules, and with all our mights,</hi> Deu. 6.4, 5. where there is two cauſes imployed, why we ought to love this one Lord; Firſt, for his, own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and being. He is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who as he hath being of himſelf, and giveth being to us: ſo he is to be loved of himſelf and for himſelf, but our Brother is to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him and for him; Secondly, for his Covenant
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:121305:106"/> of grace which he made with his Church and people, which brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Egypt, which gave his Law to Iſrael, which was the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt (as I have ſhewed.) If therefore our love be free, let us ſet it on him, who is worthy to be loved; but if our love be vendible, who is fitter for it then God, who hath paid ſo deare a price for it, and ſo dearely bought it? Let us give him our Mites, who hath given us ſo many Talents? Let us love him with all our hearts, who hath loved us with ſuch an infinite love? Let our whole affection of love be wholly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on him who is truly lovely, who placed his love on us, when there was nothing in us worthy of his love; for he did not finde, but did make us lovely, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6.</p>

                  <p>First, we muſt heare God. <hi>He that is of God, heareth God</hi> and his word, <hi>John</hi> 8.41. It is the marke that Chriſt giveth to his <hi>Sheep,</hi> that they <hi>will not heare the voyce of ſtrangers,</hi> John 10. yea, <hi>hearing</hi> is the ordinary meanes of ſalvation, <hi>Rom. 10.13, 14.</hi> That which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> called a <hi>boring of the eare,</hi> Pſal. 40. the Apoſtle ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that place, called it <hi>a fitting of the body</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>A body haſt thou fitted me,</hi> why? becauſe the eare was a principall member, whereby he gave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God his Father. This duty we owe to God alone, to whoſe Word we muſt yeild the <hi>obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26. and therefore beleeve, becauſe he ſpeaketh. It is the Pſalmiſt argument, <hi>He that made the eare, ſhall he not heare?</hi> Pſal. 94. And ſurely, we may likewiſe conclude, He that made the eare, ſhall not he be heard? In regard therefore of creation, we owe this duty to Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Father is to be <hi>heard.</hi> This Chriſt ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, when that he ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>He that heareth me, heareth him that ſent me.</hi> Chriſt indeed as God and Man, as he was the <hi>Miniſter of Circumciſion,</hi> Rom. 15.8. the great Doctor of the Church taught them from his <hi>Father,</hi> John 12.49. He came in his <hi>Fathers Name,</hi> John 5.43. and his Doctrine was his <hi>Fathers,</hi> John 7.16. He did <hi>not ſpeake of himſelf,</hi> John 7.17. But as he is the Sonne of God equall with the Father, ſo we are to heare him as we heare the Father, thus he <hi>beareth witneſſe of himſelf,</hi> John 8.18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is to be <hi>heard,</hi> Epheſ. 4.21. So
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:121305:107"/> the Father commandeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. <hi>This is my well-beloved Sonne, heare him.</hi> The Sonne himſelfe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, and promiſeth <hi>eternall life</hi> to them that heare him, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. And the Holy-Ghoſt enjoyneth it, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There is therefore a great deale of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hearing of Chriſt, and the hearing a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt Jeſus. Firſt, the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is to be <hi>heard</hi> as the Law-giver, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.34. but they are to be <hi>heard</hi> as the Interpreters of the Law; Secondly, the Lord Jeſus is to be heard of and for himſelf: the Word we receive is his <hi>Word,</hi> Col. 3.16. and he delivereth it in his own Name, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you,</hi> John 3.3, 5, 11. Joh. 5.24, 25. Joh. 6.47, 53. Joh. 8.51. Joh. 10.7. Joh. 12.24. He oppoſeth his own Authority againſt the falſe gloſſes of the falſe Teachers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22, 32, 34, 39, 44. If he did urge Scripture, it was <hi>not that he did receive teſtimony</hi> from any of the Writers thereof, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.33, 34. but firſt, in regard of his Hearers weakneſſe, who not knowing him to be the Sonne of God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the writings of his ſervants the Prophets before his Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. ſecondly, it was to teach us by his example what to doe; thirdly, it was not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his words to us by Scripture, but to confirme to us our faith in the Scriptures. But the word that the Prophets and Apoſtles had, was from him. That <hi>which I have heard from the Lord of Hoasts, the God of Iſrael,</hi> have I ſhewed you ſaith <hi>Iſaias,</hi> Iſai, 21.10. and that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:121305:108"/> which I received from the <hi>Lord Jeſus, delivered I unto you,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23. they deliver the word not in their own names, but in the Name of Chriſt, whoſe <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> they are, and in whoſe ſtead they are to be heard, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is to be <hi>heard. Let him that hath an Eare, heare what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches,</hi> Rev 1.7, 11, 17, 29. Rev. 3.6, 13, 22. It was a ſinne reproved in the Jews by <hi>Stephen,</hi> that were <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, not onely in heart,</hi> but alſo <hi>in eare,</hi> who did <hi>alwayes reſiſt the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 7.51. His power they could not reſiſt, but his Doctrine they did, whenas they would not hear it, they would not receive it. And it was confeſſed by the Jewes as a great tranſgreſſion, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.3O. that they would <hi>not give care to the Spirit of God, teſtifying aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nſt them by the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are therefore to hear the Father, the Son, &amp; the Holy-Ghoſt: yea, the <hi>hearing of one,</hi> is the hearing of all, the <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of one, is the <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of all. He that <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Sonne, heareth the Father,</hi> Joh. 5.38. Luk. 10.16. He that <hi>heareth</hi> the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt, heareth</hi> likewiſe the <hi>Sonne,</hi> Rev. 2.1, 7. The words which in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſeven Epiſtles, are aſcribed to the Sonne of God, are in the concluſion of them attributed to the Spirit of God. Jeſus Chriſt is deſcribed in all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, yet in the end of them, as if the Holy-Ghoſt were the onely Author, we are commanded to <hi>heare what the ſpirit ſaith to the Churches;</hi> Becauſe the hearing of the Spirit, is the hearing of Chriſt, who together with the Father is one with the Spirit, who are Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially one God; The Spirit proceeding inſeparably from God, cannot be divided from the Father, and the Sonne: For though he be Perſonally diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet is not Eſſentially divided from them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. He is in the Father and the Sonne, as the Spirit
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:121305:108"/> of man is in man, which is not eſſentially diſtinct from the man in whom it is.</p>

And as it is the Worke of God which he doth worke in us rightly to know him; So it is an honour which he requireth of us, and our duty which we muſt doe to him, rightly for to know him. <hi>He that commeth to God muſt beleeve that God is, and that he is the rewarder of them that ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11.6.

                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne. Thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 1.12. Phil. 2.19. And good reaſon, for he is <hi>our hope.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.1.

                  <p>The Apoſtle ſheweth there is but one <hi>hope of our calling,</hi> as well as <hi>one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one God,</hi> Eph. 4 4, 5, 6. If therefore the Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt was not one and the ſame God and Lord with the Father, it would not be one and the ſame hope in the Father, Sonne and Holy-Ghoſt. And without doubt we believe in him, we hope in him, to whom we give up our Names in Baptiſme, and with whom we doe then make a Covenant, which is one God in three Perſons, we being baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of Holy-Ghoſt.</p>

                     <hi>BAptiſme</hi> properly, and ſtrictly taken is a Sacrament of initiation, wherein thoſe to whom the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant belongeth, being waſhed with water, are conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſervice of the great Lord of heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into the Church, made partakers of all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Saints, and are bound by <hi>baptiſme</hi> to beleeve on him, to love him, to obey him to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and to glorifie him.</p>
                  <p>Where, Firſt, that we are to be <hi>baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> is manifeſt both out of the command of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> As alſo from the continued practiſe of the Church of God in all ages, and places of the Chriſtian World. Secondly, Baptiſme is a <hi>ſeale of the Covenant</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>circumciſion</hi> Rom. 4.11.) which the Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt doth make with the Church, wherein God on his part promiſeth to be our God, which is our happineſſe; and we on our part doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and oblige our ſelves to ſerve him, which is our duty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is <hi>one,</hi> Eph. 4.5. Not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is once adminiſtred; neither is it ſo onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is one ſeale of one and the ſame faith in all; Nor is it ſo onely becauſe it maketh all thoſe that are baptized, to be one body; But principally in regard
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:121305:112"/> of the Object, it is one and the ſame Covenant in all, which we make with one and the ſame God. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle therefore, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5.6. joyneth <hi>one Lord, one faith, one Baptiſme, and one God together:</hi> putting <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> before and after <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>baptiſme.</hi> It being one Lord and God in whom we believe, and one Lord and God in whole Name we are baptized.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we being received into Covenant with God in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> doe profeſſe that God alone can waſh away the filth of our ſinnes, and clenſe all the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our ſoules. To which the Apoſtle ſeemeth to allude, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord, Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> For as Water waſheth our bodies, ſo are our ſoules waſhed of God the <hi>Father, by the ſprinkling of the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2. and by the renewing <hi>of the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the former place, nameth all three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Our God,</hi> there is the Father: <hi>in the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> there is the Sonne: and by <hi>the Spirit,</hi> there is the Holy-Ghoſt. By the grace, benefit, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe three, we are Waſhed, Juſtified, Sanctified.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in that the Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with as in one Covenant with the Father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we equally promiſe Faith, Obedience, and Worſhip to them with the Father; they therefore are not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For firſt, if creatures ſhould have the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with them as is with God, and that at Gods command, This would be in God <hi>a giving of his glory to another,</hi> which God diſclaimeth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.11. ſecondly, we ſhould then confide and truſt in a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which would be a <hi>withdrawing of our hearts from the living God,</hi> and we ſhould by this meanes, bring a <hi>curſe</hi> on us, and not a <hi>bleſſing,</hi> Jer. 17.5, 7. thirdly, we
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:121305:112"/> ſhould then be tyed by Covenant to give Religious <hi>worſhip, ſervice, and obedience</hi> to a Creature, which is expreſly forbidden, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.8. and we ought not to give the leaſt Religious worſhip to them, which <hi>by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are no Gods,</hi> Gal. 4.8. Rev. 19.10. Rev. 22.9. Fourthly, we ſhould then be baptized into the Name of Creatures; It was a thing that <hi>Paul</hi> abhorred, that <hi>any ſhould think he did baptize in his owne Name,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.13.15.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, we being baptized in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt, have one and the ſame Communion with the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt. For we have</p>

                  <p>IT is Gods Honour to be <hi>prayed</hi> unto; and it is our happyneſſe that he is <hi>God that heareth prayers,</hi> Pſa. 65.2. We are taught this duty, both by <hi>Gods</hi> precept, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.14. and the faithfull mans practiſe.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeven conditions r quiſite to <hi>Prayer,</hi> two in regard of the Perſon invocating, and five in regard of the Perſon invocated; which makes prayer incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible to any, but to God alone.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is required in the Perſon invocating, that firſt he hath a <hi>precept</hi> commanding him, or at the leaſt wiſe a precedent in holy Scripture directing him to the duty he practiſeth. But there is neither precept, nor preſident for Prayer to any, but to God alone. It is a challenge ſufficient to ſtop the mouthes of all contradictory will-worſhippers, That amongſt all the Prayers made by the Saints Prophets, and Apoſtles, there is not one Prayer put up to any Saint or Angel recorded in the Word. Secondly, it is requiſite to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to pray with comfort that there be a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of being heard. Now God alone promiſeth to heare thoſe that pray unto hm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Iſai</hi> 65.24.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, is is required in the Perſon invocated, the firſt of all that he be <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> able to know all thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, more eſpecially, firſt that he know our wants: ſecondly, that he know how to ſupply all our wants: thirdly, that he know our harts, whether we pray with a pure heart: fourthly that he know whether we pray
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:121305:115"/> with faith, <hi>for whatſoever is not of faith, is ſinne,</hi> Rom. 14. laſt. Now the Lord alone is able truly to ſearch out all theſe things. Secondly, it is requiſite that he be <hi>Omnipreſent,</hi> that he be preſent with us, and doe heare our prayers: otherwiſe men may be ſubject to <hi>Elijahs</hi> bitter Sarcaſme which he gave to the Prieſts of Baal, 1 <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, it is neceſſary that he be <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> able to ſupply all our wants, and to help us againſt our corporall enemies, &amp; ſpiritual adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, when we ſue unto him. But God onely is a mighty God, and is <hi>nigh unto them that call upon him,</hi> and will <hi>fulfill the deſire of them that feare him, he alſo will heare their cry, and will ſave them,</hi> Pſal. 145.18, 19. Pſal. 34.6, 8. And that is a fourth condition requiſite in him that is prayed to, that he be <hi>willing to help</hi> us, which is proper to God, who is ready at all times to help his ſupplya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; whenas other creatures may anſ. theirs, as the K. of Iſrael anſwered his, 2 <hi>Ki.</hi> 6.27. <hi>If the Lord do not help thee, whence ſhould</hi> I <hi>help thee?</hi> Fifthly, it is needfull that he be the <hi>object of our faith</hi> to whom we pray; for <hi>how ſhall we call on them in whom we have not beleeved?</hi> Rom. 10.14. And as there is but one Baptiſme, by which God is tyed in Covenant to us to be our God, and we are tyed in Covenant to be his ſervants. So there, is but one faith in this one God, in whom we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and to whom we muſt pray. Yet this one God is diſtinguiſhed into three Perſons, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt, where you may ſafely, and with comfort direct your Prayers to one, yet with due care in worſhiping all in one. Exclude any of the Perſons, when you fix your heart on one, you offend, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.23, 24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. retaine all, and

                  <p>For firſt, the Father is <hi>prayed</hi> to Chriſt as man prayed to him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.46. <hi>Father, into thy hands</hi> I <hi>commend my ſpiri.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> prayed <hi>to the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3.14.

Yea, he promiſeth to <hi>heare</hi> our prayers, <hi>John</hi> 14.13 beſides, 2 <hi>Theſ,</hi> 2.16. <hi>Paul</hi> in his prayer puts him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father. <hi>Stephen</hi> the firſt of the Martyrs, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59. and <hi>John</hi> the laſt of all Canonicall writers, pray to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. yea all the Church pray to him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. ſo it was foretold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>He promiſeth to give us what we aſke in his Name,</hi> Joh. 14.13.

                  <p>Thirdly, the Holy-Ghoſt is <hi>prayed</hi> to by <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 1.4. and by <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.14. 2 Theſſ. 3.5. <hi>The Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and the patient

Or if he had prayed to Chriſt, he would not have ſaid <hi>the patient waiting for of Chriſt,</hi> but rather, <hi>the Lord direct your hearts to the patient waiting</hi> for of him. Thus you may ſee the Perſon that is prayed to, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Father, and the Sonne; yea the whole Church prayeth to the Holy-Ghoſt to be made fit for Chriſts preſence, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. laſt. <hi>Awake</hi> O <hi>North wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden, that the ſpices therein may flow out.</hi> O bleſſed ſpirit breath thou in my heart, that it may ſend forth a ſweet ſavour of grace.</p>
                  <p>Thus Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt are <hi>prayed</hi> to perſonally; yea, you have them all three joyned together by <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. laſt. <hi>the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the love of God the Father, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Holy-Ghoſt, be with you all, Amen.</hi> Where, foreſeeing the Hereſy of <hi>Arryus,</hi> doth there in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and alſo. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. put the Lord Jeſus before the Father.

To the end he may eſtabliſh your hearts unblameable in holyneſſe before God, even our Father at the comming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all his Saints.</hi> Where all three Perſons are perſonally prayed to; firſt, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne, in the eleventh verſe; ſecondly,

That this was not Angels (as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts imagine) but the Holy-Ghoſt, is cleare. Firſt, <hi>grace and peace</hi> commeth from him, together with the Father, and the Sonne, but come not from theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Creatures, which though they <hi>miniſter to us,</hi> Heb. 1.14. yet they worke not grace in us. Secondly, in this benediction, <hi>the</hi> 7. <hi>ſpirits</hi> are ſet before the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> which Cannot be ſo done, if they were Angels, for they are his creatures made <hi>by him, &amp; for him,</hi> Col. 1.16, he is their <hi>head,</hi> Col. 1.18. &amp; they <hi>worſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, the Lambe is ſaid to have <hi>ſeven hornes, and ſeven eyes, which are the ſeven Spirits,</hi> Rev. 5.6. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                  <p>Seeing therefore we are to pray to one God alone, and yet we pray to the Father, to the Sonne, and to the Holy-Ghoſt, as one in Eſſence, yet three in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; we ſee theſe three Perſons are one Jehovah, or Lord. In which indiviſſible Unity we adore firſt, the Father, as being altogether of himſelf: ſecondly, the conſubſtantiall Word, who is <hi>begotten of his Father,</hi> Joh. 1.16. and the co-eſſentiall Spirit, who proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Father &amp; the Son, and is the Spirit both of the Father, and of the Sonne. Oh that we could in all our wants flie unto this trinne God, as to a moſt ſure Rock of defence, then ſhould we not need to feare the fierce wrath of man, nor the fiery rage of Satan; For the <hi>wrath of man would he reſtraine,</hi> Pſal. 76.10. and through him we ſhould be able <hi>to quench all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery darts of the Devill,</hi> Eph. 6.16.</p>

                  <p>AS it is the Lords Honour to be prayed to in our neceſſities, ſo likewiſe it is to be praiſed for his graces. When therefore God <hi>bleſſeth</hi> us with his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, we muſt <hi>bleſſe</hi> him with our praiſes. For ſurely we receive all from him, fit it is that we returne all we can to him. Thus <hi>David</hi> receiving bleſſings from God, telleth you, that not onely his <hi>heart is inditing a good matter,</hi> Pſal. 45.1. but his <hi>tongue</hi> and his lips ſhall <hi>utter praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 119.171. In both places there is

This was a <hi>holy ſurfet</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> calleth it) in <hi>David,</hi> who deſired to praiſe God with heart and tongue. This Praiſe, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Bleſſing and Glory, is due to God from men and Angels. It is that which <hi>God will not give to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Iſa. 42.8.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is due to God alone, from men. <hi>The Lord alone</hi> is thus <hi>to be exalted,</hi> Iſai. 2.11. we muſt <hi>make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Righteouſneſſe, even of his onely,</hi> Pſal. 71.16. we muſt even as we have received, ſo baptize; and as we baptize, even ſo beleeve: and as we beleeve, ſo pray: and as we pray, ſo give thanks.

The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> giveth thanks to him for <hi>enabling him</hi> to the Miniſtery. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.

                  <p>Thirdly, to the Holy-Ghoſt. <hi>Zachery bleſſeth the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 1.68. That this was the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt, whom he praiſeth with the Father, and the Sonne, is evident out of the 70. v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That Doxology <hi>(glory be to the Father, and to the Sonne, and to the Holy-Ghoſt, &amp;c.)</hi> was uſed in the Church long before <hi>Arrius</hi> time, and urged by <hi>Faeba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> againſt the <hi>Arians, lib. cont.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:121305:118"/> then doe we every day blaſpheme God, when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge theſe things common to the Father, and the Sonne. The <hi>Arrians</hi> being pinched with this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, hereupon altered the forme and gave glory, <hi>to the Father, by the Sonne, and in the Spirit;</hi> which had not the <hi>Arrians</hi> given it a ſiniſter conſtruction, and made it an eſpeciall marke of recognizance, even this forme alſo had not been the voyce of Errour and Schiſme, but of ſound Doctrine, and ſincere Religion. And therefore <hi>Baſil,</hi> no friend to the Doctrine of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> yet uſeth this very forme ſometime: but it was to the offence of ſome weak Chriſtians, who did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore traduce him, and againſt whom he did largely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologize, excuſing this his act to his friends, yet juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it againſt his enemies.</p>
                  <p>Oh that we could enjoy the happy Viſion of the glorious Deity, that we might in the ſociety, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the glorified Saints and holy Angels, ſing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for ever to the glorious Trinity, and rejoyce in our <hi>Makers</hi> (ſo it is in the Originall,) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.2.

                  <p>IT is not onely the Work of Men on Earth, but it is the whole imployment of the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven to ſing forth Gods praiſes, and to doe that which may glorifie his Name. At the Creation of the World by the Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt, theſe <hi>Sonnes of God ſhouted for joy,</hi> Job 38.7. At the birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, no leſſe then a whole Hoaſt of theſe <hi>heavenly ſouldiers</hi> are prayſing and glorifying the Lord, <hi>Luk</hi> 2.14. And ſurely, if we had the <hi>tongues, not onely of Men, but alſo of Angels,</hi> we could not raiſe this note high enough to the glory of our Redeemer; yea, it is the conſtant worke of the glorified Saints, and Holy Angels to ſing forth the prayſes of God, day and night, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. Yea, the Seraphins cry one to another, <hi>holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole earth is full of his glory,</hi> Iſai. 6.2, 3. That this was the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt, who is there praiſed by the Angels, is manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it was the Father; For he whoſe praiſe is there exalted, did ſend <hi>Iſaias the Prophet,</hi> verſe 9. which was <hi>the Lord God, and his Spirit,</hi> Iſai. 4.48, 16. the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, together with the Sonne, and the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was the Sonne alſo; For he whoſe praiſe is there celebrated, <hi>Iſai ſaw his glory,</hi> Iſai. 6.1. Now that this was the Lord Jeſus, whoſe glory <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw, we have a witneſſe beyond all exceptions: even
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:121305:119"/> the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> teſtifying it, <hi>Job.</hi> 12.41. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Jeſus Chriſt, God, and Man, is joyned with God in the ſame Doxology, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. who is there called a <hi>Lambe,</hi> being ſo typifyed in the legall Rites, and ſo manifeſted to <hi>John</hi> in his heavenly Viſion. <hi>He hath ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands of Angels</hi> celebrating his praiſe, <hi>Rev. 5.11, 13.</hi> and no marvell, for theſe holy Creatures were made <hi>by him, and for him,</hi> Col. 1.16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it was the Holy-Ghoſt likewiſe; for he that is their magnified, did ſpeake by, and unto <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Iſa. 6.9, 10. Which that it was the Holy Ghoſt, is cleare, both by the teſtimony of <hi>Iſai,</hi> Iſai. 48.16. and <hi>Pauls</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Act. 28.25.</hi> yea, to him doe the Angels give glory, when he was pleaſed for the good of the Church to uſe the Miniſtery of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Ezek. 3.12, 13, 14. <hi>So the Spirit tooke me up, and I heard behind me the voyce of a great ruſhing, ſaying, bleſſed be the glory of the Lord from his place: I heard alſo, the noiſe of the Wings of the living creatures, that touched one another, and the noiſe of the wheeles over againſt them, and a noiſe of a great ruſhing;</hi> ſo the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away, &amp;c. It being the glorious appearance of the <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> that in this place is deſcribed, as one and the ſame action of him, both before and after ſheweth, who is there glorified with the Father, and the Sonne. For the <hi>honouring</hi> and glorifying one, is the <hi>honouring,</hi> and glorifying the other alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23.</p>
                  <p>Thus is Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt, who are one God, though three perſons, is one and the ſame Divine prayſe celebrated by the glorious Angels. And ſurely if the Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt had not been God equall with the Father, they had not had one and the ſame praiſe given by Angels to them, with the Father; For otherwiſe <hi>Gods glory had been given to another,</hi>

The filching of temporall things by men, may be acquitted either with a ſingle, or double, a foure-fold, or ſeven-fold reſtitution. But the filching and ſtealing of Gods glory by Angels, could never, have been anſwered.</p>

                  <head type="sub"> The Temple of Jeruſalem, was the Houſe of the Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt</head>
                  <p>It was the Honour of the Lord to have a publike place of Worſhip; wherein the Jews offered both ſpirituall ſacrifices of prayer, and praiſe, as alſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſacrifices expiatory, and gratulatory of ſheep, and beaſts, &amp;c. which place of Divine worſhip, was called the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> Iſa. 56.7. <hi>The Temple of the Lord,</hi> Pſal, 65.5. Mat. 21.12. <hi>His dwelling place,</hi> 2 Chr. 36.15. Pſal 9.11. Pſal. 74.2. yea the Jews held forth this as a buckler againſt all blowes, putting a carnall confidence in this ſpirituall priviledge. They thought it Canon proof againſt all the oppoſitions of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſuppoſed though they took liberty to live as, they liſt, yet that God would not ſuffer his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to be defiled by the Heathens, or trodden under foot of the Gentiles. <hi>They truſted in lying words, ſaying, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 7.3. Thus had they made <hi>lyes their refuge, and under
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:121305:120"/> falſhood did they hide themſelves.</hi> But the Lord cared not to live in a Houſe of Stone amongſt them, who would not have themſelves <hi>living ſtones built up to him,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. He would not dwell in them as in a materiall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which refuſed to have him to dwell in them, as in his ſpirituall Temple; Notwithſtanding, as long as Iſrael kept Covenant with God, God dwelt in this Houſe amongſt them, and God was honoured, and worſhiped by them, in this place which was the Temple of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it was the <hi>Temple</hi> of God the Father. The Lord Jeſus calleth it his <hi>Fathers Houſe,</hi> Joh. 2.16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it was the <hi>Temple</hi> of God the Son, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>The Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple.</hi> His was the materiall Temple, whoſe body, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19, 21. was that holy Temple, in whom <hi>all the fulneſſe of the God-head dwelt bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. And in regard of Chriſts Corporall preſence in this: <hi>the glory of the ſecond Temple was greater then the glory of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> Hag. 2.9. Albeit there was neither in this latter, (as there was in the former) the Ark, nor Mercy-ſeat, nor Cherabins, nor fire from heaven which conſumed the ſacrifice, nor the Majeſty of divine preſence called Shekena, nor Prieſt with Urim, &amp; Thummim, nor after <hi>Malach</hi> any Prophet. (The <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> as the Jews ſay, <hi>being gone into Heaven</hi>) yet in regard the Lord of glory preached there in his own Perſon, the glory of this Temple, was greater then the glory of Solomons. Beſides, the Lord Jeſus purging this <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>driving</hi> out the uſurpers thereof, manifeſted himſelf to be the Lord, not onely of this place, but of the World, who not onely taught with Authority, but alſo acted with ſuch divine power, as none durſt reſiſt him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:121305:121"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, is was the <hi>Temple</hi> of God the <hi>Holy-Ghost who gave theſe divine Oracles,</hi> Levit. 16.2. with Heb. 9.6, 7, 8. He appointed the Legall ſervices therein. This the Apoſtle taketh as granted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.7, 8. For after he had ſpecified the particulars, and the Laws ordained by God for the manner, and uſe of them, he addeth by way of interpretation. <hi>The Holy-Ghoſt this ſignifying, &amp;c.</hi> And without doubt his was the <hi>materiall Temple</hi> of ſtone, who hath ſpirituall <hi>living Temples</hi> conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. 1 <hi>Car.</hi> 3.16. who being God dwelleth in us as in his <hi>Temple.</hi> None but God alone ought to have any <hi>Temple</hi> conſecrated to his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Seeing that Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghoſt, have one, and the ſame <hi>Temple</hi> conſecrated to the ſervice of them, they are therefore co-equall in power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being one and the ſame God which was worſhiped in this Houſe, and whom <hi>Iſaiah ſaw in a Viſion</hi> ſitting <hi>on his Throne</hi> (as I have formerly ſhewed) <hi>and his Traine filled the Temple,</hi> Iſai 6.1.

                  <p>Yet ſacrifices was offered,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, to the Sonne. Although, firſt, as he is the Mediator of the New Covenant, God and man, his <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was typified in the <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. which in themſelves <hi>were ſhadowes of things to come, but the body of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.17. without this <hi>one oblation offered by Chriſt,</hi> all other were imperfect, unſatisfactory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. for the ſins of mankind had ſo kindled the fiery wrath of God, that the Bloud of Buls, or of Goats, or of Sheep, could no longer quench it, but it would have broken out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an open flame, if ſo be that the Sonne of God had not come, and extinguiſhed it with his own bloud; <hi>It being not poſſible that the bloud of Buls, or of Goats, ſhould take away ſinnes,</hi> Heb. 10.4. But <hi>Chriſt by one offering hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.12, 14. Heb. 9.28. And thus he was a ſacrifice for ſinne; yet ſecondly, as he was the ſecond Perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9.5. He was equall with the Father, <hi>Zac.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. and he was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Father ſacrificed to; <hi>Jaacob</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>goe to Bethel,</hi> and <hi>build an Altar there unto God that appeared unto him,</hi> Gen. 35.1, 7. And <hi>Jaacob powred on the Altar,</hi> he built <hi>a drink-offering, and oyle,</hi> Gen. 35.9, 14. That this was Chriſt, <hi>Hoſeah</hi> ſheweth <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4, 5. when he called him an <hi>Angel,</hi> yet his Name was <hi>the Lord of Hoaſts.</hi> The Sonne in Scripture being uſually ſo ſtiled: who was an <hi>Angel in Name,</hi> but <hi>not in Nature,</hi> Heb. 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Heb. 2.16. He was that <hi>Angel which ſpake to Moſes on
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:121305:122"/> the Mount,</hi> Act. 7.38. and and commanded the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to the Holy-Ghoſt. The Attonement was made to him, together with the Father, and the Son, who did <hi>appeare in the Cloud upon the Mercy-ſeat,</hi> Lev. 19.2. with Heb. 9.7, 8. where the Apoſtle doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay (interpreting theſe Leviticall Rites) that it was the Holy-Ghoſt that ſignified this thereby.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore, the Father, the Sonne, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt, had one and the ſame honour done to them by Sacrifice in the Temple, you may ſee that their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is one, their worſhip one, their honour one, their glory one, who are one, and the ſame God in Eſſence, Subſtance, and Nature, though they be three Perſons, ſubſiſtences, or Relations, in which they differ from one another.</p>

                  <p>IT is the duty of the faithfull to make Gods glory the higheſt and ultimate end of all their Actions and that they live ſo, that they may glorifie God here, and that God may glorifie them hereafter.

                  <p>Firſt, the Father is to be glorified, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> The light of grace that is in thee, muſt ſo ſhine forth from thee, that other men may have the light of grace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them to ſee how to glorifie God thereby.

                  <p>Secondly, the Sonne is to be glorified. Chriſt was <hi>glorified</hi> in his Apoſtles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.10. They were to his praiſe, and inſtruments of his glory. It was <hi>Pauls</hi> end in living; <hi>To me to live is Chriſt</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.22, 23. and <hi>Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or death,</hi> Phi. 1.20. yea, <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. to <hi>ſanctifie,</hi> or <hi>glorifie the Lord God in your hearts,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> addeth, <hi>that they may be aſhamd that accuſe your good converſation in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.16. by having a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, we glorifie Chriſt which is truly God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20.</p>

                  <p>Thus we are to endeavour both by word and deed, to glorifie the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy-Ghoſt. And ſurely the glorifying of one Perſon, is the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of all. The <hi>Leper</hi> who <hi>fell Chriſts feet,</hi> and <hi>gave thanks</hi> to him, is ſaid to glorifie <hi>God,</hi> Luk. 17.15, 16. glorifying thereby, not onely the Sonne, but alſo the Father, and the Holy-Ghoſt; yea, <hi>Peter</hi> ſheweth you, that the ſuffering patiently for the <hi>Name of Chriſt,</hi> is the <hi>glorifying</hi> of the Father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11, 16. and of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15, 16. 1 Pet. 16. and of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.14, 16. The <hi>honouring</hi> one, is the <hi>honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> of the other, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, he that by Apoſtacy or Antichriſtianiſme diſhonoureth one, <hi>diſhonoureth</hi> the other likewiſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. Take heed therefore of Satans ſpeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deluſions, who would have thee honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by denying the Sonne. <hi>He that denyeth the Sonne, the ſame hath not the Father,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.23. but <hi>is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.22. he is Antichriſt, that denyeth the Father, and the Sonne. Jews, Turks, Arrians and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hereticks, may affirme they worſhip him that was the true God who was the Creator of the World, but he is the Father of Chriſt, and him they deny: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deny alſo the Father, he being not a Father, if he have not a Sonne, and he hath no other Sonne properly, but Chriſt. Let us indeavour in the whole courſe of our lives, to give the Lord the honour due to his Name. Let us therefore in heart and voyce give glory to the Father, to the Sonne, and to the Holy-Ghoſt; and let us conclude with the Pſalmiſt, in ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
